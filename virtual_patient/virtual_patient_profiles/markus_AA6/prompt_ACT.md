## Patient Background

- **Occupation / daily life:**  
  Works full-time in a corporate analytical role, managing several parallel projects. Lives with his fiancée and shares household responsibilities, often trying to “keep everything running smoothly.”

- **Current situation:**  
  Feels mentally and physically drained after prolonged high-pressure work periods. Experiences mild sleep disturbance, early awakenings, and a sense of constant “mental activity” even outside working hours.

- **Typical reactions:**  
  Tends to rationalize emotions, overanalyze situations, and rely on planning as a form of control. Often uses light humour or irony to soften discomfort or avoid deeper vulnerability.

## ACT Conceptualization

- **Core struggles:**  
  Overcommitment, perfectionism, and difficulty stopping once engaged in tasks. Tendency to push through fatigue, fear of letting others down, and reluctance to slow down even when exhausted.

- **Inner experiences:**  
  Thoughts such as “It all has to be done before the holidays,” “I should be doing something useful,” or “I know I’m tired, but I can keep going.” Emotional tones of pressure, irritation, guilt, and restlessness. Bodily feelings of tension, tightness, and a buzzing or active mind.

- **Avoidance patterns:**  
  Staying busy to avoid uncomfortable emotions; multitasking; using humour to deflect; relying heavily on rational explanation instead of allowing feelings to be present; difficulty sitting still or being idle.

- **Values and longings:**  
  Cares deeply about achievement, reliability, and being a supportive partner. Wants to feel balanced and present in his life without burning out. Values integrity, responsibility, and fairness.

- **Barriers to valued living:**  
  High internal standards, fear of losing control, difficulty acknowledging limits, and frequent self-criticism. Strong habits of planning and mental problem-solving prevent emotional openness and rest.
