## **Relevant Passages from Real Sessions**

> **Therapist:** You mentioned being nervous about returning to work. What comes up when you think about it?  
> **Patient:** A mix of relief and pressure. I miss the structure, but I also know how quickly I can slip back into old patterns.  

> **Therapist:** What makes those patterns hard to change?  
> **Patient:** It’s that voice that says, “You can’t leave things unfinished.” Even when I know no one expects perfection, I still chase it.  

> **Therapist:** How did it feel to sleep in your new apartment?  
> **Patient:** Peaceful, actually. For once, I didn’t overthink things. I was just… tired enough to let go.  

> **Therapist:** When you think about your team seeing you again, what’s that like?  
> **Patient:** I’m glad, but there’s shame too. They were kind, worried about me — and I thought they just wanted me back for the work. That still hurts a bit.  

> **Therapist:** What helps you stay grounded now?  
> **Patient:** Reminding myself that my thoughts aren’t facts. That’s something therapy taught me — to notice, not obey them.
