# Transcript T12

[1]

Patient: I've been feeling a bit lost lately. After the health scare, it's like I've been wandering
         around in a fog, not sure what I'm supposed to be doing with myself. I've been a chef for
         so long, it's who I am, but now I'm starting to question what else there is for me beyond
         that. It's like I'm stuck at a crossroads and I'm not sure which way to go.

Therapist: Being a chef is a big part of who you are, and now you're questioning what's next. What
           specific parts of being a chef do you feel like you're questioning or unsure about? Is it
           the actual cooking, the creative aspect, the social aspect of working in a kitchen, or
           something else entirely?


[2]

Patient: I've always loved the creativity that comes with cooking, the rush of a busy kitchen, and
         the camaraderie of the staff. It's like a dance, and I'm the choreographer. But lately,
         I've been feeling more like a spectator than a participant. I guess it's not the cooking or
         the kitchen itself that's the problem, it's more like I'm questioning if this is all there
         is for me. I've been feeling like I want something more, but I don't know what that is.

Therapist: That's a really poignant way to describe feeling like a spectator. It sounds like there's
           a part of you that's craving something more than just the routine of cooking, even though
           it used to bring you so much joy. What does "something more" mean to you? Is it about
           personal growth, helping others, pursuing a specific interest, or something else
           entirely?


[3]

Patient: I wish I knew what "something more" meant for me. I guess I'm just feeling like there has
         to be more to life than the four walls of a kitchen. I've always been so focused on my
         career, and now that I've had this health scare, it's like I've been forced to pause and
         take stock of my life. I don't want to wake up one day and realize I missed out on
         something important. I just don't know what that something is.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're living in someone else's script, and now
           you're wondering what your own story could be. You mentioned feeling like you've been so
           focused on your career. What about the other areas of your life? Are there any hobbies,
           relationships, or experiences that you've put on the backburner that you're now thinking
           about revisiting or making more time for?


[4]

Patient: I've never really had much time for hobbies, always been about the kitchen. But I used to
         love going to the farmer's market on my days off, talking to the vendors, getting inspired
         by the fresh produce. I haven't done that in years. And I've let a lot of friendships fade
         away, always too busy to nurture them. I had a friend years back, we used to talk about
         opening a little bed and breakfast somewhere quiet. I haven't even spoken to her in ages.

Therapist: It sounds like there are some pieces of you that have been put on the backburner, like
           your love of the farmer's market and that dream of the bed and breakfast. What do you
           think is preventing you from making time for those things now? Is it a fear of change, a
           sense of being too established in your career, or something else entirely?


[5]

Patient: It's not so much fear, more like inertia. I've been doing this for so long, it's like I'm a
         train on tracks, just kept going in the same direction because that's what I've always
         done. I don't even know if those things would make me happy anymore, or if they're just
         faded memories of what I used to want. Plus, I'm not getting any younger. It's hard to not
         feel like I've missed my chance to make a change. But then again, I don't want to look back
         and wonder what could have been.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between the comfort of what you know and the uncertainty of
           what could be. You're weighing the risks of making a change against the potential regrets
           of staying the same. What is it that you hope to achieve or experience by making a
           change, even if it's not clear what that looks like yet? What's the kind of life or
           experiences you're hoping for that would make it feel like you're truly living the life
           you want?


[6]

Patient: I guess I want to feel like I'm living life on my own terms. Like I'm not just going
         through the motions, but actually experiencing things, you know? I want to feel connected
         to something bigger than myself. Maybe that's reconnecting with old friends, maybe it's
         finding new hobbies, maybe it's even helping others in some way. I don't know exactly what
         it looks like, but I want to feel like I'm choosing my path, not just walking down the one
         that was laid out for me. I want to feel alive, not just alive.

Therapist: That's a powerful aspiration – wanting to live life on your own terms and feel connected
           to something bigger than yourself. It sounds like you're yearning for a sense of
           authenticity and purpose. What do you think is the essence of "feeling alive" for you? Is
           it about experiencing new things, pursuing your passions, or something more fundamental,
           like a sense of belonging or contribution?


[7]

Patient: I think for me, feeling alive is about being present in the moment, not just caught up in
         the day-to-day grind. It's about finding joy and meaning in what I'm doing, whether that's
         cooking or something else entirely. I want to feel like I'm making a difference, even if
         it's just in small ways. Like maybe teaching others about food, or even just sharing a meal
         with friends. I want to feel like I'm part of something, not just an observer. But it's
         hard to know where to start, especially at this stage of my life.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to break out of observer mode and become a
           participant in life. You've got a sense of what you want, which is really helpful. What's
           one small step you could take today or this week to start moving towards feeling more
           present, connected, and purposeful? Maybe it's as simple as reaching out to an old
           friend, trying a new recipe, or volunteering in your community. What's one thing you
           could do that would feel like a tiny step in the right direction?


[8]

Patient: I could start by taking a morning walk through the local park. I used to love being
         outdoors, feeling the sun on my face, but it's been ages since I've done that. It wouldn't
         be anything big, but at least it would be a start, a way to reconnect with the world
         outside the kitchen. Maybe I could even look into volunteering at the community garden.
         I've always loved plants and the idea of growing my own ingredients. I don't know if I'm
         ready for any big changes yet, but I think I can handle that.

Therapist: Taking a morning walk through the park and looking into volunteering at the community
           garden are great first steps. It's amazing that you're willing to take the first step,
           even if it's small. How do you think you'll handle the uncertainty that comes with trying
           something new, like volunteering at the community garden? What if it's not exactly what
           you expected, or if you encounter challenges? How might you approach those moments of
           uncertainty?


[9]

Patient: I think I'll just have to take it one day at a time. I know it won't be perfect, and that's
         okay. I just have to remember why I'm doing it – to feel more connected, to feel like I'm
         contributing something. If it doesn't go as planned, or if it's not what I expected, that's
         alright. I can learn from it and adjust. I've always been adaptable in the kitchen, so I
         think I can bring that same mindset to this. It's just important to remind myself that it's
         okay not to have all the answers right away. I can figure it out as I go.

Therapist: It sounds like you're cultivating a really valuable mindset – being open to the unknown,
           learning from mistakes, and trusting yourself to figure things out as you go. Can you
           think of any other areas of your life where you might be able to apply this same mindset,
           where you've been stuck or uncertain? Maybe there are other "kitchens" or areas of your
           life where you can bring this same sense of adaptability and willingness to take small
           steps towards change?


[10]

Patient: Maybe I could start looking into those old recipes I've been meaning to try, the ones that
         always seemed too complicated or time-consuming. I could treat them like little
         experiments, just like the community garden. If they don't turn out perfect, that's
         alright. It's more about the process, about trying something new. And maybe I could think
         about reaching out to some old friends. It feels daunting, after all this time, but maybe I
         can start small, just a message or a call to catch up. If it feels awkward at first, that's
         okay. We can figure it out as we go.

Therapist: It sounds like you're embracing the idea that growth and exploration can be messy and
           imperfect, and that's where the real learning happens. Can you imagine what it might feel
           like to lean into that discomfort, to be willing to take small risks and try new things,
           even if they don't turn out exactly as planned? What do you think you might learn about
           yourself and your relationships by doing so?


[11]

Patient: I think it might feel liberating, but also a bit scary. Like jumping into the deep end of a
         pool. But I think I could learn a lot about what truly brings me joy, what I want and need
         from life and from the people I'm close to. I've been so focused on the kitchen for so
         long, and now I realize that I might have missed out on some things, on some relationships.
         I'm curious to see what else is out there, what else I might love doing. I think I could
         learn to be more open, more present. But it's also terrifying, feeling this vulnerable.
         What if I don't like what I find? What if I realize I've wasted all this time?

Therapist: It sounds like you're acknowledging that this path of discovery might be a bit scary, but
           also potentially incredibly rewarding. You're wondering what if you don't like what you
           find, but what if you do? What if you discover a new passion, a new sense of purpose? Can
           you imagine being kind to yourself as you take these steps, even if they don't lead
           exactly where you hope? What would that kindness look like, and how might it support you
           in this process?


[12]

Patient: I think being kind to myself would mean giving myself permission to fail, to not have all
         the answers. It would mean acknowledging that I'm trying my best, and that's enough. Maybe
         it would look like taking breaks when I need to, not forcing myself to keep going when I'm
         feeling overwhelmed. It would mean reminding myself that I'm worthy, no matter what I
         achieve or don't achieve. I think it would make this process feel less daunting, more like
         an adventure than a test.

Therapist: It sounds like you're developing a beautiful sense of self-compassion, one that allows
           you to be kind to yourself and acknowledge your worthiness. Can you imagine what it would
           be like to bring this same kindness and acceptance to other areas of your life, not just
           this process of exploration? How might that change your relationship with yourself and
           your experiences?


[13]

Patient: I think it would make me feel more at peace, more content with where I am right now. I've
         always been so hard on myself, always pushing for the next thing. But if I could bring this
         kindness to all areas of my life, maybe I could just be present, enjoy the moment. Maybe I
         wouldn't feel so stuck, so directionless. I think it could change everything, honestly. But
         it's hard. It doesn't come naturally to me, this kindness. I'll have to work on it.

Therapist: It's amazing that you're recognizing the potential for kindness to change everything for
           you. Developing self-compassion is a practice that takes time and effort, but it's worth
           it. What do you think would be a small, manageable step for you to start practicing
           self-compassion in your daily life? Maybe it's as simple as taking a few deep breaths
           before bed, or writing yourself a kind note each morning. What's one tiny step you could
           take today to start cultivating this kindness?


[14]

Patient: I could start by just checking in with myself each night before bed. Ask myself how I'm
         feeling, what I'm grateful for, what I'm struggling with. I could write it down in a
         journal, just a few sentences. I think that would help me stay connected to myself, to my
         needs and wants. It's something small, but I think it could make a big difference. I just
         need to remember to be honest with myself, not to judge or dismiss my feelings.

Therapist: That's a beautiful idea, checking in with yourself each night to tune into your feelings
           and needs. Remembering to be honest and non-judgmental with yourself will be key. What do
           you think would happen if you were to be kind and compassionate with yourself when you're
           struggling or feeling uncertain? How might that change your experience of those moments?


[15]

Patient: I think if I could be kind to myself in those moments, I wouldn't feel so alone. I wouldn't
         feel like I was just stuck, like there was no way out. I might not spiral so much, get lost
         in the negative thoughts. Instead, I could remind myself that it's okay to struggle, that
         everyone has moments of uncertainty. I could reach out for help, talk to someone about what
         I'm going through. It could make those moments feel more manageable, less overwhelming. But
         it's hard to remember when you're in it, you know?

Therapist: It's like you're acknowledging that self-compassion is not just about being kind, but
           also about being aware of when you're struggling and needing support. What do you think
           would be a signal for you that you're spiraling into negative thoughts, and what might be
           a small step you could take to interrupt that pattern and practice self-compassion?


[16]

Patient: I think my biggest sign is when I start feeling really restless, like I can't sit still,
         can't focus. That's usually when I'm stuck in my head, going down the rabbit hole of
         negative thoughts. I think if I could recognize that feeling, maybe I could take a pause, a
         deep breath. Maybe I could ask myself, "What do I need right now?" Maybe it's a break,
         maybe it's talking to someone. But just something to interrupt the cycle, to bring me back
         to the present. It's worth a try, at least.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a really important step towards interrupting the cycle of
           negative thoughts. Recognizing your physical and emotional cues is huge, and taking a
           pause to ask yourself what you need is a great way to bring yourself back to the present.
           Can you imagine trusting yourself to know what you need in those moments, even if it's
           not always clear? How might that sense of self-trust change your relationship with
           yourself and your experiences?


[17]

Patient: I think if I could trust myself more, I wouldn't feel so anxious all the time. I wouldn't
         second-guess every decision, every feeling. It would be a relief, honestly. But it's scary
         too, putting that much faith in myself. What if I make the wrong choice? What if I don't
         know what I need? I guess that's where the self-compassion comes in. If I make a mistake, I
         can learn from it, try again. I don't have to be perfect, I just have to be willing to
         listen to myself, to trust that I know what's best for me, even if it's not always clear.

Therapist: It's amazing that you're recognizing the importance of self-compassion in this process.
           What if, instead of focusing on the fear of making the wrong choice, you focused on the
           possibility of learning and growth? What if you saw mistakes as opportunities for
           self-discovery and self-compassion, rather than as failures?


[18]

Patient: Easier said than done. I've always been one to beat myself up over mistakes. But I see your
         point, I do. If I could look at them as opportunities, maybe I wouldn't be so afraid. Maybe
         I could even be curious, see what I can learn. But it's hard to shift that mindset, you
         know? It's ingrained. I will try, though. Maybe start by just acknowledging when I make a
         mistake, not judging it. That could be a start.

Therapist: That's a great place to start - acknowledging mistakes without judgment. Can you imagine
           what it would be like to approach mistakes as a curious observer, rather than a critical
           one? What would you ask yourself when you make a mistake, if you were approaching it with
           curiosity?


[19]

Patient: What led me to this mistake? What can I learn from it? What might I do differently next
         time? It would be more like a puzzle to solve, rather than a failure to dwell on. But I
         said it before, and I'll say it again, it's harder than it sounds. I will give it a shot,
         though.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step towards reframing your relationship with
           mistakes. Remember that it's a process, and it might take time to shift your mindset.
           What do you think would be a small, achievable goal for you to work towards in the next
           week, in terms of applying this new perspective to your mistakes?


[20]

Patient: Maybe I can start by just catching myself when I start to be critical. Just notice it, not
         even try to change it at first. Just say to myself, "I'm doing it again." That would be a
         start, just building that awareness. Then maybe next time I make a mistake, I can ask
         myself one of those curious questions. Baby steps, right?

Therapist: That's a great approach - starting with small, achievable steps. Noticing your critical
           thoughts without judgment is a huge step in itself. What do you think would happen if you
           continued to build on this awareness, and started to ask yourself those curious questions
           more regularly?
