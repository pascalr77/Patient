# Transcript T15

Patient: I've been feeling really stuck lately. Since the layoffs at my last job, I've been
         struggling to find a new position, and it's got me thinking, what do I even want to do with
         my life? Being a software developer is all I've known, but now I'm not sure if it's what
         matters to me most.

Therapist: That sense of uncertainty can be really unsettling. What about your work as a software
           developer - was there something specific that made it fulfilling for you, something you
           miss now that you're not doing it?


[2]

Patient: I miss the problem-solving aspects, the problem to solution cycle. The satisfaction of
         seeing a project through, finding meaning in the details. But I'm not sure if that's enough
         to keep me fulfilled long term. It's like there might be, or should be, something else.

Therapist: That makes sense, the problem-solving aspect is a big part of what drives many people in
           tech. You're wondering if there's something more, though - what comes to mind when you
           think about what's missing, what would make you feel like you're really making the most
           of your work?


[3]

Patient: I'm not sure, really. I just feel like I've been going through the motions for a while.
         Maybe it's about feeling more connected to people? Or like I'm contributing to something
         more meaningful. It's all a bit vague, honestly. I just know there's a emptiness sometimes
         when I think about my career.

Therapist: That sense of emptiness can be tough to navigate. When you think about feeling more
           connected to people or contributing to something meaningful, is there a particular
           context where you feel like you're already connected - maybe through a hobby,
           volunteering, or relationships outside of work - that you could draw from for inspiration
           about what you're looking for in your career?


[4]

Patient: Not really, that's part of the problem. I've been so focused on work for so long that I've
         let other things fall by the wayside. I don't have much in the way of hobbies or
         volunteering. I guess I've always been the type to put work first, but now I'm wondering if
         that was a mistake.

Therapist: That's a big shift in perspective, wondering if prioritizing work was a mistake. What
           would it look like for you to start making time for other areas of your life, maybe even
           just a small step, like setting aside an hour a week for something outside of work -
           what's one thing you've always been curious about or enjoyed in the past that you could
           try to revisit?


[5]

Patient: I've always enjoyed reading, especially about history and science. I used to spend hours
         just learning new things. But it's been a while since I've really made time for it. Maybe I
         could start by setting aside an hour on the weekend to read something just for the fun of
         it. Just finding something I'm interested in, no real goal in mind.

Therapist: That sounds like a great way to start, setting aside time to read for enjoyment without
           any expectations. What if, in addition to reading, you also made a small commitment to
           yourself to share what you've learned with someone - a friend, family member, or even
           just a journal entry - to see if that adds an extra layer of engagement and motivation?


[6]

Patient: I'm not sure I'm ready to share with others yet. It feels a bit too personal, like I'm not
         ready to reveal that side of myself. Maybe the journal entry idea could work, though. Just
         something private where I can jot down my thoughts and reactions to what I've read. A small
         step, like you said.

Therapist: Writing in a journal can be a great way to explore your thoughts without sharing them
           with others. What do you think would happen if you started to see your career path as an
           opportunity for personal expression and growth, rather than just a means to a paycheck -
           would that feel more aligned with who you are and what you value?


[7]

Patient: That sounds good in theory, but I'm not sure how to make that shift. I've always seen work
         as, well, work. Something I do to pay the bills and use my skills. It's hard to imagine it
         being more than that. But I guess if I could find something that combines my interests and
         skills, maybe, just maybe it could become something fulfilling.

Therapist: Let's take your problem-solving skills, for example - those are still valuable even
           outside of software development. Are there any areas of history or science that you're
           particularly interested in, where you could see yourself applying those problem-solving
           skills in a different way, maybe even in a role that's more aligned with your values?


[8]

Patient: I've always been drawn to environmental science and climate change research. I guess I
         could look into data analysis roles in that field. It would be a way to use my skills for
         something that matters. But it feels so beyond my comfort zone.

Therapist: That's a big step you're considering, moving into a field that's not just new to you, but
           also deeply meaningful. What's one thing that's making you feel like it's beyond your
           comfort zone - is it the subject matter, the industry, the type of work, or something
           else?


[9]

Patient: It's mostly the idea of starting over in a new industry. I've been in tech for so long, I
         know the language, the culture. Starting fresh in environmental science feels daunting.
         What if I'm not good at it? What if I don't fit in? It's scary to think about.

Therapist: Those are some big fears you're facing - what if you're not good enough, what if you
           don't fit in. Can you tell me more about what's driving those thoughts - is it past
           experiences, someone else's opinions, or something else that's making you think you won't
           be able to succeed in this new field?


[10]

Patient: It's mostly my own doubts. I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, so starting something
         new where I won't be immediately good at it is tough. Plus, I've heard the jobs in that
         field can be really competitive and hard to come by. I don't want to invest all that time
         and effort only to end up unemployed again. It feels risky.

Therapist: That's a lot of self-awareness - recognizing your perfectionism and the fear of
           competition. What if, instead of seeing the risk as a threat, you saw it as an
           opportunity to learn and grow - not necessarily to be perfect, but to develop new skills
           and experiences that could ultimately make you a stronger candidate in the long run?


[11]

Patient: Easier said than done. I get what you're saying, but it's hard to just flip a switch and
         see it as an opportunity. Part of me still feels like I should just stick to what I know,
         even if it's not fulfilling. Less risky, I guess. But I do see where you're coming from,
         and I wish I could just make that mental shift.

Therapist: It's like you're weighing the pros and cons of each path, and the safe option feels like
           a more familiar, comfortable choice. Can you imagine a scenario where you're 5-10 years
           down the line, and you've stuck with your current path - what does your life look like
           then?


[12]

Patient: Okay, so if I stay on my current path... I'm probably still working as a software
         developer, maybe I've moved up the ladder a bit. Life is comfortable, predictable. But I
         still have that nagging feeling of emptiness, like I could have done more, been more. I see
         myself looking back and wondering "what if?". That's not a great feeling to imagine.

Therapist: It sounds like staying on your current path might lead to a sense of regret, wondering
           "what if." What if, instead of asking "what if," you were to ask yourself, "what if I
           take a chance and pursue a career in environmental science - what would that allow me to
           experience or achieve that you're not getting with your current path?"


[13]

Patient: Well, if I took that chance, I guess I'd feel like I was making a difference. Like my work
         mattered, really mattered. Maybe I'd be working on projects that could have a real impact
         on the world. And maybe, just maybe, I'd feel more connected. To nature, to other people
         who care about the same things. It's a scary thought, but also kind of exciting. More
         meaningful, you know?

Therapist: That sense of excitement and purpose is really palpable - it sounds like you're tapping
           into a deeper value of making a positive difference. What if you were to take that sense
           of excitement and purpose as a compass, guiding your next steps - what small, tangible
           action could you take today to move closer to this vision of making a meaningful impact?


[14]

Patient: I'm not sure about today, but maybe this week I could look into some online courses or
         workshops about environmental science. Just to dip my toes in, see what it's all about. I
         could also look into volunteering opportunities or local environmental groups. See if it
         feels right before I fully commit. Baby steps.

Therapist: Those are great, small steps to take - exploring online courses, volunteering, and local
           groups can give you a feel for the field and help you build connections. What if, as you
           take these small steps, you also commit to checking in with yourself regularly - maybe
           weekly or bi-weekly - to see how you're feeling, what you've learned, and what's working
           for you, so you can continue to make progress and adjust your path as needed?


[15]

Patient: That sounds reasonable, but I'm not great at self-reflection. I might need some help with
         that. Maybe we could set aside some time in our sessions to talk about how it's going? That
         way I'm being held accountable, but also have some support while I figure things out. What
         do you think?

Therapist: I think that's a great idea - regular check-ins can provide a safe space to explore your
           thoughts, feelings, and progress. Let's schedule a regular check-in, say, every other
           week, to discuss your experiences, challenges, and insights. We can work together to
           develop a structure that feels comfortable for you, so you can stay on track and make
           progress towards your goals.


[16]

Patient: Every other week sounds good. I think I'd like that. A little accountability, someone to
         talk things through with. But I also don't want to rush things. I need to go at my own
         pace. So if I haven't made much progress, or I'm feeling stuck, I need to know that's okay
         too.

Therapist: I completely understand that you need to go at your own pace, and it's great that you're
           acknowledging the importance of self-compassion. What if, as you work through this
           process, you also make a conscious effort to be kind to yourself when you're feeling
           stuck or not making progress - can you imagine how that might help you stay motivated and
           engaged?


[17]

Patient: I can imagine it, but it's hard to put into practice. I'm so used to being critical of
         myself. But I guess if I can start to notice when I'm being too hard on myself, maybe I can
         pause and try to reframe it. Tell myself it's okay to have off days. It won't be easy, but
         I can try. Seems like a good thing to work on in our check-ins too.

Therapist: That's a great plan to start noticing when you're being too hard on yourself and try to
           reframe it. Let's make a small experiment for our next check-in - for the next week,
           whenever you catch yourself being overly critical, I want you to pause and ask yourself,
           "What would I say to a friend in this situation?" - can you try that and see what
           happens?


[18]

Patient: I can try that. It feels a bit strange, but I'll give it a go. So, for the next week, I'll
         try to pause and ask myself that question when I'm being too critical. Let's see what
         happens.

Therapist: That's a great first step. Remember, it's not about changing who you are, but about
           becoming more aware of your thoughts and patterns. We'll explore this further in our next
           session, but for now, just focus on being kind to yourself and trying out this new
           approach. See you in two weeks.


[19]

Patient: See you in two weeks. I'll do my best.

Therapist: Sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to our next session and hearing about your
           experiences. Take care of yourself until then.


[20]

Patient: Thanks, you too. Bye.

Therapist: Bye for now.
