# Transcript T24

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've just been feeling so overwhelmed. Ever since my son
         moved out for college, I've been struggling to find motivation for anything. It's like a
         sadness I can't shake off, and I think it's starting to affect my relationship too.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. When you say you're struggling to find motivation, what's one
           activity or area of your life that you used to enjoy but now feels particularly hard to
           get started on, and what's going through your mind when you're feeling this way?


[2]

Patient: I used to love reading, but lately even picking up a book feels like a huge task. It's like
         there's this voice in my head telling me, "What's the point?" I just feel so tired and
         overwhelmed all the time, like everything is too much effort. And I've also started to feel
         more distant from my spouse because they are unable to understand my feelings.

Therapist: That voice saying "What's the point?" sounds really disempowering. Can you tell me what
           you think is the point of reading for you, and how that might have changed since your son
           moved out?


[3]

Patient: I always loved reading because it was my way to relax and escape from the stress of work
         and life. But now, with my son gone, it's like I don't need that escape anymore. I don't
         know, it's hard to explain. It's like my world has become quieter, and reading, which used
         to fill my mind, now just emphasizes that emptiness and quiet.

Therapist: It sounds like reading, which used to bring you comfort, now feels like a reminder of the
           emptiness you're feeling. What's one thing you think you'd like to do with this quieter
           time now that your son is gone, something that could potentially bring a sense of purpose
           or fulfillment?


[4]

Patient: I guess I've thought about taking a class or maybe volunteering somewhere. I've always
         wanted to learn a new language, maybe Spanish. But it's hard to motivate myself to actually
         sign up for something. It's like I'm stuck in this rut, and even though I know I should do
         something, I just can't seem to take that first step.

Therapist: That sense of being stuck can be really frustrating. What do you think would happen if
           you were to sign up for that language class or volunteer, but then, on the day of the
           first session, you didn't show up or didn't feel like going? What's the worst that would
           happen?


[5]

Patient: I guess I'm afraid I'd just be proving to myself that I'm as stuck as I feel. Like, if I
         can't even follow through on something new, then maybe this is just who I am now, someone
         who's always going to feel this way. And then there's the fear of wasting money on a class
         I might not attend, or letting people down if I volunteer and then don't show up. It's like
         I'm setting myself up for failure before I even start.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between the fear of being stuck and the fear of failure,
           which is causing you to hesitate. What's more important to you: taking a chance on
           learning something new and potentially failing, or staying in a place of uncertainty and
           feeling stuck?


[6]

Patient: I guess if I think about it that way, taking a chance sounds more appealing. I just don't
         want to feel like this forever, you know? Like, even if I fail, at least I'll have tried
         something. But it's still scary. I don't know if I'm ready.

Therapist: What would be one thing you'd like to tell your future self, 6 months from now, when
           looking back on this moment of hesitation? What would you want to be able to say about
           how you handled this uncertainty and fear?


[7]

Patient: I'd like to be able to tell my future self that I at least tried, that I didn't just stay
         stuck in this rut. Even if it's just signing up for that Spanish class and going to the
         first few sessions, I want to know that I gave it a shot. I guess I'd want to say that I
         was brave, even if it was just a small step. I'd want to say I didn't waste the past 6
         months in the same sadness and lack of motivation.

Therapist: It sounds like you're wanting to be able to say that you took a step towards being brave
           and moving forward, even if it's just a small one. You're wanting to break free from the
           feeling of being stuck and take control of your life again. What's one small step you can
           take today, right now, to move in that direction, even if it's just signing up for that
           Spanish class or making a phone call to inquire about it?


[8]

Patient: I could look up Spanish classes online, just to see what's out there. I don't have to
         commit to anything right away, but just seeing what's available might help me feel like I'm
         moving forward. Maybe I could even send an email or text to inquire about a friend who took
         one. Baby steps, right? But I'm not promising I'll sign up today, I just want to do a bit
         of research.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Looking up Spanish classes online and reaching out to your
           friend who took one are both small, manageable steps that can help you feel like you're
           moving forward. Remember, it's not about promising to sign up today, but about taking
           small actions that align with your values and sense of bravery. What do you think will be
           the first thing you notice or feel when you take this step, even if it's just looking up
           classes online?


[9]

Patient: I think I might feel a little bit anxious, but maybe also a bit relieved? Like, at least
         I'm doing something, you know? I think I might notice that it's not as scary as I built it
         up to be in my head. But I might also feel overwhelmed by the choices and uncertain about
         how to decide which class to take, if any. I just want to be sure I'm making the right
         choice, whatever that is.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about making the "right" choice, but what if the idea of
           choice itself is what's causing the anxiety? What if you were to approach this like
           you're not making a permanent decision, but rather, you're taking a temporary step
           towards exploring your interest in Spanish?


[10]

Patient: That makes sense. It's just hard for me to not think about the long-term implications, I
         guess it's just how I am. But maybe if I think about it like I'm just dipping my toes in,
         it wouldn't feel so heavy. Like, I'm not committing to anything long-term, I'm just
         exploring, right? I'll try and look up some beginner classes and maybe just try a free
         trial session if that's available. I can always change my mind later, right?

Therapist: Exactly, you're not committing to anything long-term, you're just taking a small step to
           explore your interest in Spanish. And if you decide it's not for you, that's okay. The
           goal is to move forward, not to make a permanent decision. What would be the first thing
           you'd like to learn or experience in this free trial session, just to get a taste of what
           it's like to learn Spanish?


[11]

Patient: I think I'd like to learn some basic phrases. Maybe even just how to introduce myself and
         say a few things about my life. I guess I'm curious to see how it feels to speak in a
         different language, even if it's just a little bit. And maybe it will give me the
         confidence boost I need to keep going. But let's see how it goes, no promises.

Therapist: It sounds like you're approaching this with a sense of curiosity and openness, which is
           exactly what's needed to move forward. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a
           time and adjust your approach as you go. We can check in on your progress and see how
           you're feeling about it in our next session. For now, I'm proud of you for taking this
           small step towards exploring your interest in Spanish.


[12]

Patient: Thanks. I'll do my best, but let's see how things go before we start talking about next
         steps.

Therapist: Let's wrap up here for today. To recap, you've identified a desire to take action and
           explore your interest in Spanish, and you've committed to taking small steps towards that
           goal. You've also acknowledged the importance of being kind to yourself and not putting
           too much pressure on the outcome. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time
           and adjust your approach as you go. I'll look forward to hearing about your progress in
           our next session.


[13]

Patient: Alright, see you next time.

Therapist: See you next time. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions
           or need any support before our next session.


[14]

Patient: Thanks, you too.

Therapist: It was great working with you today. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Patient: Yeah, see you then.

Patient: Did I do something wrong? You seem distant suddenly.

Therapist: No, you didn't do anything wrong. I'm just wrapping up our simulation session. It was a
           pleasure playing the role of an ACT therapist with you. If you want to simulate another
           session or try a different scenario, just let me know!
