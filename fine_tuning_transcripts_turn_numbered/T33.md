# Transcript T33

[1]

Patient: Hey there, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been stuck in this cycle of worrying about my
         business performance, which is really getting in the way. I've been procrastinating more
         than I'd like to admit and I know the fear of not being great is keep me from getting
         started.

Therapist: What does it mean to you when you think about not being great with your business? What
           are the thoughts that come up for you in that scenario?


[2]

Patient: Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag, really. On one hand, I think about the disappointment from
         those who've backed me, my employees, my family and friends. The fear of letting them down.
         I worry about failing. I worry about losing everything I've built up until this point. It's
         like a dark cloud of "what ifs" just hanging over my head. But then, there's also this tiny
         voice telling me that maybe I'm just being dramatic, you know? That I should just snap out
         of it. It's all quite confusing, to be honest.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about this voice that says you should "snap out of it"? What does it
           sound like, and what's its tone like?


[3]

Patient: Oh, that little guy? He's a charmer, let me tell you. Sounds a bit like an old coach I had
         back in my sports days. Very matter-of-fact, no-nonsense type. Always throwing out lines
         like, "Come on now, others have it worse" or "Stop being so dramatic, just tough it out".
         It's not nasty or mean, just... firm. Like it's trying to give me a good kick in the pants.
         Not always what I need, but it's there nonetheless.

Therapist: When you hear that voice telling you to "tough it out," what's the immediate effect on
           your motivation or willingness to take action?


[4]

Patient: You know, it's a bit counterintuitive, but when I hear that voice, I actually feel less
         motivated. It's like, the more I'm told to "tough it out" or "snap out of it," the more I
         dig my heels in and resist. I start feeling more overwhelmed, like I just want to shut down
         and avoid it all. So, instead of jumping into action, I find myself procrastinating even
         more. It's like my body's way of rebelling against that voice, even though I know it's just
         trying to help.

Therapist: What do you think this voice is trying to protect or achieve by pushing you to "tough it
           out"?


[5]

Patient: Honestly, I think it's trying to keep me from appearing weak or vulnerable. It's like it's
         saying, "Come on, you're a business owner. You've got to be strong and have it all
         together." I guess it's trying to protect my image and reputation, both personally and
         professionally. It's probably trying to achieve some sense of control and stability in my
         life. But sometimes I wonder if it's more harm than good, you know?

Therapist: Can you imagine what your business would look like if you were to let go of the need to
           appear strong and in control all the time? What values or qualities might guide your
           decisions and actions if you were to prioritize being authentic and vulnerable instead?


[6]

Patient: Wow, that's a tough one. If I let go of that need to appear strong, I think my business
         might look a bit messier, but maybe more real, more human. I imagine there'd be more
         delegation, more asking for help when I need it. I think I'd be more open with my employees
         and maybe even my clients about the challenges we're facing.

As for values, authenticity and honesty come to mind. Also, collaboration and humility. If I were to
prioritize being authentic and vulnerable, I think my decisions would be more focused on growth and
learning, rather than just appearing like I have all the answers. It's a scary thought, but there's
a part of me that feels drawn to it, too.

Therapist: What's one specific decision or action you could take in the next week that would reflect
           your value of authenticity, even if it feels scary or vulnerable?


[7]

Patient: Well, I've been putting off a conversation with my team about some recent setbacks. I think
         being authentic would mean calling that meeting, being honest about the struggles we're
         facing, and asking for their input. It's scary, because it means admitting I don't have all
         the answers, but it's probably the right thing to do. Let's see if I can muster up the
         courage to schedule that for next week. No promises, but I'll think about it.

Therapist: What would be the smallest, most concrete step you can take this week to move forward on
           scheduling that meeting, even if it's just sending a calendar invite or drafting a simple
           agenda?


[8]

Patient: Alright, I hear you. I guess the smallest step would be to send out a calendar invite for
         the meeting. Just to get it on everyone's radar. I don't have to have all the details
         figured out right away. I can just call it a "Team Check-in" or something like that. I
         think I can manage that much this week.

Therapist: What's the one thing you're willing to commit to doing immediately after sending out that
           calendar invite, to ensure that you follow through on this valued action?


[9]

Patient: You know what? I'll commit to drafting one single agenda item for the meeting. Just one.
         That way, I'm not overwhelming myself with too much at once, but I'm still taking a step
         forward. I think I can handle that.

Therapist: What does it mean to you to "take it one step at a time" in this context, and how can you
           remind yourself of this commitment when faced with uncertainty or fear about what's to
           come?


[10]

Patient: To me, taking it one step at a time means focusing on the immediate task at hand without
         getting bogged down by the big picture. It's about breaking things down into manageable
         bits and not letting the future what-ifs trip me up. When I start feeling uncertain or
         afraid, I think a simple reminder like "Just this one thing for now" could help. Maybe I
         could set it as a little note on my desk or something. Who knows if it'll work, but it's
         worth a shot, right?

Therapist: How can you make "Just this one thing for now" a part of your daily routine, perhaps by
           incorporating it into your morning or evening reflection, or by placing it somewhere
           you'll see it often?


[11]

Patient: I like the idea of putting it somewhere I can see it, but I'm not much of a poster or
         sticky note kind of person. I think maybe setting a daily reminder on my phone could work.
         Just a little notification that says "Just this one thing for now." I look at my phone
         often enough, so that might help keep me on track. Let's give it a shot and see how it
         goes.

Therapist: What does it mean to you to "acknowledge your efforts" when faced with setbacks or
           challenges, and how can you show yourself kindness and compassion in those moments?


[12]

Patient: For me, acknowledging my efforts means recognizing that I'm trying my best, even when
         things aren't going as planned. It's not just about the results, but the work I put in.
         Showing myself kindness and compassion, well, that's a bit tougher. I guess it could mean
         talking to myself like I would a friend in the same situation. Maybe saying something like,
         "You're doing the best you can, and that's enough for now." It feels a bit cheesy, but I
         think it could help shift my perspective. I don't know if I'll be great at it, but I can
         give it a try, right?

Therapist: Can you imagine incorporating this self-compassionate language into your daily routine,
           perhaps as a closing phrase at the end of each day, or as a gentle reminder when you're
           feeling overwhelmed?


[13]

Patient: Incorporating it into my daily routine, huh? I'm not much for daily affirmations or
         anything like that. But I guess, when I'm feeling overwhelmed, I could try reminding myself
         that I'm doing the best I can. Maybe set an alert on my phone or something, just a simple
         "You're doing fine" kind of thing. Not sure if I'll stick to it, but I suppose it's worth a
         shot. Nothing too over the top, mind you. Let's keep it casual, okay?

Therapist: What does it mean to you to "accept uncertainty" in this context, and how might you use
           your new reminder to help you stay grounded in the present moment when faced with
           uncertainty?


[14]

Patient: To me, accepting uncertainty means acknowledging that I can't control every outcome, no
         matter how much I plan or worry. It's tough, because I like having a semblance of control.
         But I guess using my new reminder, "You're doing fine," could help bring me back to the
         present. It's a way of telling myself that regardless of what's coming, I'm handling things
         right now, and that's enough. Easier said than done, of course. But I can try.

Therapist: Can you imagine what it would be like to view uncertainty as an opportunity for growth
           and learning, rather than something to be feared or controlled? How might you use your
           reminder, "You're doing fine," to help you shift your perspective in those moments when
           uncertainty arises?


[15]

Patient: Viewing uncertainty as an opportunity, huh? That's a tall order. But I suppose if I can
         pause and use my reminder, maybe it could help. Like, if I'm feeling uncertain about a
         business decision, instead of freaking out, I could say to myself, "You're doing fine. This
         is a chance to learn and grow." It sounds a bit cheesy, but maybe it could help shift my
         mindset. I don't know if I'll buy into it right away, but I can try it out and see what
         happens. No promises, though.

Therapist: What's one specific decision or situation that you're currently facing where you could
           apply this new perspective, and what's the smallest, most concrete step you could take to
           move forward with curiosity and openness, rather than fear or avoidance?


[16]

Patient: There's this potential partnership I've been on the fence about. It could be great, but
         it's also a bit risky. I guess the smallest step I could take is to set up an initial
         meeting, just to explore it more. See what it's all about. No commitments, just gathering
         information. I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in full force, but maybe just dipping a toe in
         will help. Let's see how it goes.

Therapist: What does it mean to you to "dip a toe in" in this context, and how can you use this
           approach to continue taking small, calculated steps towards exploring the partnership,
           even if it's uncertain or uncomfortable?


[17]

Patient: Dipping a toe in, to me, means taking a small, low-risk step just to check things out. No
         big commitments, just gathering info. With the partnership, I guess it could look like
         setting up another meeting, or asking for more detailed information about their proposals.
         Maybe even trying out a small-scale project together first. I don't want to rush into
         anything, so taking it slow, one step at a time, feels more comfortable. I can always pull
         back if it doesn't feel right, you know? Let's see how it goes.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling more confident and in control of your approach to the
           partnership. What does it mean to you to "pull back" if things don't feel right, and how
           can you use this as a signal to re-evaluate your priorities and values?


[18]

Patient: Pulling back, to me, means stepping away if something doesn't sit well. It's not about
         giving up, but rather taking a pause to reassess. If I feel like pulling back from this
         partnership, it might be a sign that it's not aligning with my priorities or values. Maybe
         it's too risky, or maybe it's taking me away from what I really want for my business. If
         that happens, I think I need to take a step back and ask myself, "What do I really want out
         of this? What's important to me right now?" It's not about making a rash decision, but
         rather checking in with myself, you know?

Therapist: That's a beautiful way to approach decision-making. Can you imagine what it would be like
           to trust this process of pausing and reassessing, and how it might allow you to make more
           intentional decisions that align with your values and priorities?


[19]

Patient: Yeah, I think if I can trust this process, I might feel less pressure to rush into things.
         It would give me the space to really think about what I want and need, rather than just
         reacting to whatever comes my way. I think it would help me make better decisions for my
         business, and for myself too. It's not going to be easy, and I'm sure I'll have my doubts,
         but maybe with time, I can learn to trust it more. We'll see.

Therapist: What's one thing you can do in the next week to start practicing this process of pausing
           and reassessing, even if it's just for a small decision or situation?


[20]

Patient: Hmm, maybe I can start with something small, like deciding on a new supplier for one of our
         lesser products. I can take a step back, consider the options, and check in with myself
         about what feels right. I don't have to rush it. Just take a beat, think it through, and
         then decide. Let's see how that goes first before I tackle the bigger stuff. One step at a
         time, right?

Therapist: What does it mean to you to "take a beat" in this context, and how can you use this
           phrase to remind yourself to pause and reflect before making decisions, even when you
           feel pressure to act quickly?
