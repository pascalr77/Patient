Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've just been feeling really low, like I'm stuck in a
         rut. The restaurant hasn't been doing great and I'm struggling to keep up with bills. It's
         put a lot of strain on my relationship too. I just feel like I'm letting everyone down.

Therapist: That feeling of being stuck and low sounds really tough. When you say you feel like
           you're letting everyone down, what does that mean to you? What would it look like if you
           were no longer carrying that weight of responsibility?


[2]

Patient: I guess I just mean I'm not living up to their expectations? Like, my partner has been so
         supportive, but I feel like I'm just dragging them down with me. If I wasn't feeling this
         way, I'd be more present in the relationship, more fun to be around, you know? Not always
         stressed about money or feeling sorry for myself. I want to be someone others appreciate
         and value. But right now, it's like I don't value myself.

Therapist: It sounds like you're hoping that if you could get your financial and emotional situation
           together, you'd feel more worthy and appreciated by others. What would it mean to you to
           start valuing yourself, not because of how others see you, but because of who you are,
           regardless of what's happening with the restaurant or your finances?


[3]

Patient: Wow, that's a tough one. I'm not really sure, to be honest. I guess I've always tied my
         worth to what I can do for others, how I can make them happy. It's hard to imagine feeling
         good about myself just as I am, without all that stuff. But maybe it would feel...
         peaceful? Like I could just be, and not have to prove anything.

Therapist: That sense of peace sounds like it could be a really powerful experience. What does being
           able to just "be" without needing to prove anything to others look like in your daily
           life? For example, if you were walking down the street or running errands, how would you
           notice the difference in how you're experiencing yourself?


[4]

Patient: I think I'd just feel more relaxed, like I could go to the market and not be constantly
         looking over my shoulder, worrying about who I might run into and what they might think of
         me. I'd be more present, enjoying the moment instead of being caught up in my head. Maybe
         I'd even notice more of what's going on around me instead of being stuck in my own stuff. I
         think I'd laugh more too, just be more like the real me, the person I am when I'm with
         people I feel really comfortable with.

Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful way to be. What if being "the real you" was about living in
           alignment with your values, like being honest, hardworking, and supportive? How might you
           start to act on those values in your daily life, even when it's hard, like now?


[5]

Patient: I dunno, it's just so hard to think about values when I'm barely getting by. But I guess,
         maybe I could start small? Like, even if I can't pay all the bills, I can still be honest
         about it, talk to my partner about what's really going on. I hate feeling like I'm hiding
         stuff from them. And even if I'm not feeling great, I can still try to be supportive, you
         know? Like, check in with my friends, see how they're doing. Maybe that would help me feel
         more like myself, even if everything else is a mess.

Therapist: That's a great place to start. What would it take for you to commit to being honest with
           your partner and checking in with friends, even when it feels hard or scary? What would
           be the first step you'd take, and what would you say to yourself to remind yourself of
           why it's important to do this, even when things feel tough?


[6]

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'd have to just... do it. Make the choice and stick to it. Maybe the
         first step would be to just tell my partner what's really going on with the bills, how much
         we're behind. I hate even thinking about it, but I guess I'd remind myself that they
         deserve to know the truth, and that I'm not helping anyone by keeping secrets. Even when
         something feels hard of scary, it's important to remember that facing the problem is a
         solution. I'd tell myself that I'm doing this because I value honesty and I value my
         relationship, and that's what matters in the long run. Plus, maybe it'd feel good to just
         have it all out in the open, you know?

Therapist: That's a powerful commitment to make. What would you do if your partner reacted poorly to
           the news about the bills? Not because you're expecting them to, but just for yourself -
           how would you handle that, and what would you remind yourself to stay on track with your
           values?


[7]

Patient: I'd probably feel really awful at first, but I think I'd just have to remind myself that I
         did the right thing, that I was honest and that's what matters. I'd probably want to fix
         it, make everything better right away, but maybe I'd just need to sit with it, you know?
         Let my partner have their feelings, let myself have mine. And then maybe we could figure it
         out together. I'd just have to keep reminding myself that I'm doing this because I value
         honesty and I value our relationship, and that's worth fighting for, even if it's hard.

Therapist: That sounds like a really healthy way to approach it. What if you were to take this
           approach not just with your partner, but with yourself as well? What would it mean to be
           kind to yourself, to sit with your own feelings and struggles, rather than trying to fix
           everything right away?


[8]

Patient: I'm not sure, really. It's easy to say I'd be kind to myself, but when it comes down to it,
         I just want to fix stuff. I don't want to feel bad, you know? But I guess if I were really
         going to try, I'd just... let myself feel crappy for a bit. Like, really feel it, not just
         try to push it away. Maybe tell myself that it's okay to have a bad day, that it doesn't
         make me a bad person. I don't know, it's hard to even imagine. But maybe it'd be... nice?
         Like, a relief or something.

Therapist: That's a really interesting idea. What if you were to take a moment right now to
           acknowledge how you're feeling, not trying to fix anything or change it, but just
           noticing it? What would it be like to simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling really
           overwhelmed right now, and that's okay"?


[9]

Patient: Wow, that feels really weird to say. But kinda good too, I guess. It's just... it's not how
         I usually think. I always want to fix things, make them better. But yeah, I am feeling
         really overwhelmed. And it is okay, I guess. It's just... where do I go from there?

Therapist: That's a great place to start. What if, instead of trying to figure out where to go from
           here, you were to simply take the next step that feels like it's in the right direction?
           Not the next big step, not the one that solves everything, but just the next small step.
           What would that be?


[10]

Patient: I guess maybe I'd just... talk to my partner. Like I said before. Just tell them what's
         going on, how I'm feeling. It's not gonna fix everything, but it's something, you know?
         It's a start.

Therapist: That's a great plan. It sounds like you're taking a big step towards being more authentic
           and honest with your partner. What do you think you might learn or gain from having this
           conversation, even if it's just the beginning of a bigger process?


[11]

Patient: I don't know, really. I guess maybe I'd learn that... it's okay to be vulnerable, to not
         have all the answers. Maybe I'd gain a little more trust, both in myself and in my partner.
         Maybe we'd feel more connected, even if it's hard at first. I think it could be good, even
         if it's scary.

Therapist: That's a beautiful vision. What if, when you're having this conversation with your
           partner, you were to approach it with an openness to whatever happens, rather than trying
           to control the outcome? What would it mean to be present with the uncertainty and see
           where it takes you?


[12]

Patient: You know, that sounds really nice and all, but it's also kinda terrifying. I like to know
         what's gonna happen, you know? But I guess if I was really gonna do this, be present and
         all, I'd just... I'd just have to trust, right? Trust myself, trust my partner. Trust that
         whatever happens, we'd figure it out. But that's way easier said than done.

Therapist: That's a big step. What if, instead of trying to trust that everything will work out, you
           were to focus on trusting the process of being present and open with your partner? What
           would it mean to trust the act of having this conversation, rather than the outcome?


[13]

Patient: I dunno, that's still pretty scary. But I guess it'd mean just... being there, really
         listening, really talking. Not just trying to get to the end goal, you know? It's like,
         when I'm cooking, I can't just rush to the final product, I've gotta trust the process,
         each little step. Maybe this is kinda like that. But it's way harder when it's feelings,
         you know? Much easier to trust some recipe than to trust myself, trust the process with my
         partner.

Therapist: That's a really insightful comparison. What if you were to take this approach to the
           conversation with your partner - not trying to rush to the end goal, but being fully
           present in each moment, each step of the conversation? What would it be like to trust the
           process of being with your partner, even if it's uncomfortable or uncertain?


[14]

Patient: I guess if I could do that, it'd feel... real. Like, really being with them, not just going
         through the motions. But it's so hard, you know? I just wanna know what's gonna happen,
         wanna make everything okay. But maybe, maybe it'd be okay to just be in it, just be with
         them, even if it's hard. Even if I don't know what's coming next. I dunno, it's just...
         it's really hard to wrap my head around.

Therapist: That's a really beautiful place to be. What if, as you're having this conversation with
           your partner, you were to say to yourself, "I'm not in control, and that's okay. I'm just
           going to be here with you, and see what happens"?


[15]

Patient: Wow, that's... that's really hard to even think about saying. It's scary, you know? But
         also... kinda freeing, maybe? Like, I don't have to have all the answers. I can just... be
         there. Just be with them. Yeah, it's okay if I'm not in control. It's okay, and I'm just
         going to be here with you, see what happens.

Therapist: That's a huge step forward. It sounds like you're starting to see that being present and
           letting go of control is not only okay, but it's also a choice that can bring you closer
           to your partner and yourself. What if you were to carry this mindset into other areas of
           your life, not just this conversation with your partner, but in general? What would it
           mean to approach challenges and uncertainties with this sense of surrender and presence?


[16]

Patient: Whoa, that's a big question. I don't know, really. I guess it'd mean just... letting go a
         bit, you know? Trusting that whatever happens, I can handle it. Or at least, I can be
         present with it. It's like, when I'm cooking and something goes wrong, I can't just freak
         out, I've gotta stay present, figure out how to fix it. Maybe life is kinda like that too.
         Maybe I can just... be with it, even when it's hard. Even when I don't know what's coming.
         Yeah, maybe. But it's still scary, still feels really uncertain and weird.

Therapist: That's a really insightful comparison. What if, as you're navigating the uncertainty of
           life, you were to approach it with a sense of curiosity, rather than fear? What would it
           be like to ask yourself, "What's happening right now?" or "What's showing up in this
           moment?" rather than "What's going to happen next?"


[17]

Patient: Huh, yeah. That's... that's interesting. It's like, instead of worrying so much about the
         future, I could just... look around, you know? See what's right in front of me. I guess
         it'd feel kinda... free, maybe? Like I'm not so stuck in my head, not so anxious about
         what's coming. But it's weird too, it's not how I usually think. It's like I'm always just
         one step ahead, always planning. But maybe... maybe it'd be okay to just... be here, you
         know? Just see what's happening right now.

Therapist: That's a huge step forward. What if, as you continue to explore this new way of being,
           you were to allow yourself to be kind to yourself when you catch yourself getting caught
           up in planning or worrying about the future? What would it mean to say to yourself, "It's
           okay, I'm doing the best I can, and I can always come back to the present moment"?


[18]

Patient: Aw man, that's... that's really hard. I wanna say yes, yeah, I can do that, but... it's not
         easy, you know? I beat myself up a lot, I know I do. But maybe... maybe I could just...
         try, you know? Just try to be a little kinder, a little more patient. Say stuff like that
         to myself, remind myself that it's okay, that I'm doing my best. Maybe it'd help, maybe it
         wouldn't, but... but maybe I could just try. See what happens, right? No guarantees, but...
         but maybe.

Therapist: That's a huge step forward. What if you were to start small, just for today, and say to
           yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"? What would it be like to give
           yourself permission to make mistakes and not be perfect, and just focus on taking care of
           yourself in this moment?


[19]

Patient: "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough." Wow, that's... that's really hard to say.
         Hard to believe, even. But... but maybe I could just try it, you know? Just for today, just
         for this moment. Maybe it wouldn't fix everything, maybe it wouldn't make all the scary
         stuff go away, but... but maybe it'd be a start, you know? A start to being kinder to
         myself, to letting go a bit. Maybe. We'll see. It's worth a shot, I guess.

Therapist: That's a great place to start. What if, as you go about your day, you were to remind
           yourself of this phrase, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough", and see how it
           feels to carry that with you?


[20]

Patient: Yeah, okay. I'll try it. I mean, it feels weird, but... but maybe it'll help, you know? I'm
         doing the best I can, and that's enough. I'll just keep telling myself that, see how it
         goes.

Therapist: That's a great plan. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about being present and
           kind to yourself. Take it one step at a time, and see how it goes.
