# Transcript T10

[1]

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been struggling with being around people. I get
         really anxious in social settings, even with friends. It's been so bad that I've just been
         avoiding everyone. It's not helping my mood, but I don't know what else to do.

Therapist: What does your anxiety feel like in social situations? Is it a physical sensation, a
           thought, or something else entirely?


[2]

Patient: It's a mix of things. My heart races, I feel shaky, like I can't catch my breath. It's not
         just that, though. My mind goes into overdrive, thinking about what others are thinking
         about me, worrying I'll say or do something stupid. It's like my brain and body are on high
         alert.

Therapist: When you're in these situations and your mind is racing with thoughts about what others
           are thinking, what do you think you're trying to achieve or protect by having those
           thoughts?


[3]

Patient: I guess I'm trying to protect myself from being judged or looking foolish. It's like if I
         can predict what others are thinking, I can somehow prepare and not get caught off guard.
         But it's exhausting, and it doesn't really work. I just end up more anxious.

Therapist: If you were to let go of trying to predict what others are thinking and just focus on
           being present in these social situations, what would be some things you value about being
           around people, like friends, that you'd be missing out on by avoiding them?


[4]

Patient: If I could just focus on being present, I think I'd enjoy the laughter and the camaraderie.
         I value the sharing of stories, the feeling of belonging. I miss that. I miss feeling
         connected to others, feeling like I'm part of something. But it's hard to imagine just
         letting go.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to stop the anxiety from happening, you were to allow it to be
           there, even while you're sharing a laugh or feeling a sense of belonging? What would that
           be like for you?


[5]

Patient: I'm not sure I know how to do that. If I let the anxiety just be there, won't it take over?
         Won't I be a mess? I don't want people to see me like that. I don't want to feel out of
         control.

Therapist: When you say you don't want to be a mess, what does that mean to you? Is it that you'd be
           unable to function, or is it more about being judged by others?


[6]

Patient: It's both, I guess. I don't want to fall apart, to be incapable of handling things. But
         also, I don't want people to see me struggle. I don't want them to think I'm weak or crazy.
         I already judge myself enough for feeling this way, I don't need others doing it too.

Therapist: What would be the impact on your relationships with others if you were to be more open
           and honest about your struggles with anxiety, rather than trying to hide them or present
           a perfect facade?


[7]

Patient: I'm not sure. I guess I'm afraid people will treat me differently, like I'm fragile or
         something. But maybe, if they know what I'm going through, they'd understand me better.
         Maybe I wouldn't feel so alone in it. But it's scary to think about being that vulnerable.
         I don't know if I'm ready for that.

Therapist: What's more important to you: having relationships where you feel seen and understood,
           even if it means being vulnerable, or avoiding potential judgment and maintaining a sense
           of control, even if it means feeling more isolated?


[8]

Patient: I want to be seen and understood, I really do. I'm just not sure I can handle the
         vulnerability that comes with it. I mean, I already feel so exposed, so raw. I don't know
         if I can handle more. But I'm also tired of feeling so alone, so I guess it's something I
         need to think about.

Therapist: What would be one small step you could take to move closer to being more open and
           vulnerable with someone you trust, even if it's just a tiny step, like sharing a smaller
           aspect of your anxiety with them?


[9]

Patient: Maybe I could start by just saying I've been struggling with anxiety lately. I don't have
         to go into details, just put it out there. See how they react. It's not much, but it's a
         start, right? I don't know, it still feels hard. But I could try.

Therapist: That's a great start. What's one thing you can do this week to take that small step, like
           sharing your anxiety with someone you trust, and how will you take care of yourself
           afterwards, in case it's still uncomfortable?


[10]

Patient: I guess I could talk to my buddy Jake. He's always been pretty understanding. Maybe I'll
         just casually bring it up when we're hanging out this weekend. Afterwards, I think I'll go
         for a long drive, blast some music. That usually helps me unwind.

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a plan in place for taking care of yourself after sharing with
           Jake. What do you think you'll do if, after talking to him, you find that you're not as
           anxious or stressed as you thought you'd be? How might that change your perspective on
           being open and vulnerable in the future?


[11]

Patient: I don't know, maybe I'll feel a bit relieved. Maybe it won't be as bad as I thought. I
         guess if it goes okay, I might feel more confident about opening up again in the future.
         But I don't want to get ahead of myself. Let's see how this goes first.

Therapist: That's a very grounded approach. What's one thing you'll do to check in with yourself
           after talking to Jake, to see how you're feeling and if you've taken any steps towards
           your value of being open and connected with others?


[12]

Patient: I'll journal about it. Just take a few minutes to write down how I'm feeling, what
         happened. It helps me sort out my thoughts. Maybe I'll see if I do feel more connected, or
         if it's something I want to keep working on.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be really helpful in
           clarifying things. What do you think you might do with what you learn from journaling, if
           you find that you do feel more connected or more motivated to continue working on being
           open with others?


[13]

Patient: If I find that I do feel more connected, maybe I'll try to build on that. Maybe I'll try to
         open up a bit more, take another small step. I don't know, I don't want to rush into
         anything. But if it feels right, I'll consider it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a really thoughtful and intentional approach to this
           process. How might you define success for yourself in the next few weeks, in terms of
           your goal of being more open and connected with others?


[14]

Patient: I guess success would be just trying. Even if it's just a couple of times, even if it's not
         perfect. If I can just push myself a little, that's something. I don't want to set the bar
         too high, you know? I don't want to set myself up for failure. But I think trying is a good
         starting point.

Therapist: That's a great way to approach it. What's one thing you can do this week to remind
           yourself that trying is enough, even if things don't go perfectly, so that you can stay
           on track with your goal of being more open and connected with others?


[15]

Patient: Maybe I'll set a reminder on my phone. Just something simple like "It's okay to just try".
         I see it enough, maybe I'll start to believe it. I don't know. Worth a shot, right?

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a very practical approach to supporting yourself. What do
           you think you'll do if, after seeing that reminder, you still find yourself getting
           caught up in worries about perfection and trying to avoid vulnerability?


[16]

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'll just try to take a breath, remind myself that this is hard. That
         it's okay to struggle. I don't have to have it all figured out. Maybe I'll reach out to
         you, if that's alright. I could use the support.

Therapist: That's a great plan. You're welcome to reach out to me anytime you need support. What's
           one thing you're looking forward to in terms of your relationships or your sense of
           connection with others, that you're hoping to work towards in the coming weeks or months?


[17]

Patient: I guess I'm looking forward to feeling less alone. Maybe even feeling understood. I don't
         know if that's asking too much, but it's something I want. I just want to feel like I'm
         part of something again. Like I belong.

Therapist: Feeling like you belong and are part of something is a beautiful thing. What does it mean
           to you to feel understood by others, and how do you think that might change your
           relationships or interactions with others?


[18]

Patient: I guess feeling understood means they get it, they get me. They see what I'm going through,
         and they're there for me. I think if I felt that, I'd be more at ease. I wouldn't feel so
         anxious all the time. Maybe I'd be more open, more myself. I think it would change
         everything, really. But it's scary to hope for.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to hope for something that feels this vulnerable. What's one
           thing you can do to take a small step towards creating a situation where you might feel
           understood by someone, like reaching out to a friend or sharing your hopes with someone
           you trust?


[19]

Patient: Maybe I can talk to Jake again. Tell him I want to feel more understood. Maybe he'll get
         it, maybe he won't. But at least I'll know I tried. That's something, right?

Therapist: That's a great plan. What do you think you'll do if Jake responds in a way that's
           supportive and understanding, and you feel like he gets it? How might that impact your
           feelings about yourself and your relationships?


[20]

Patient: If Jake responds well, I think I'll feel relieved. Maybe even a bit more confident. Like
         maybe I'm not so alone, so weird for feeling this way. Maybe it'll make it easier to open
         up again in the future, with him or others. But I don't know, I don't want to count my
         chickens before they hatch. Let's see what happens first.

Therapist: That's a very down-to-earth approach. What's one thing you can do to take care of
           yourself and manage your expectations, no matter what happens when you talk to Jake?
