# Transcript T17

[1]

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. I've just moved, started a new job as a social worker, and
         everything feels overwhelming. I thought I had my life figured out, but lately I've been
         feeling stuck, like I'm just going through the motions. I'm not sure what I really want or
         what matters to me aside from work. It's been keeping me up at night.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, feeling like you're just going through the motions and
           questioning everything. When you say you thought you had your life figured out before,
           what specifically did you feel like you had under control or that you were proud of
           accomplishing?


[2]

Patient: I graduated top of my class, got a job as a social worker right after school. I thought I
         had this clear path, you know? Help people, make a difference. But now, it feels like
         that's all I have. Like, what do I want besides that? What else is there? I'm not so sure,
         and that's a really uncomfortable feeling to deal with.

Therapist: It sounds like the uncertainty about who you are outside of your role as a social worker
           is causing a lot of discomfort. What does the idea of having a clear sense of identity
           outside of your job look like to you?


[3]

Patient: I'm not really sure. I guess I see people with hobbies, or a clear sense of what they want
         in life, and it seems like they have some kind of inner compass. Like, they know what they
         stand for and what makes them happy. But for me, it's just a big question mark. I go to
         work, come home, and then what? I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing with myself
         outside of that. It's not like I'm unhappy being a social worker, but it feels like there
         should be more to me than that. But what that 'more' is? I'm totally lost.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're living someone else's expectation of what
           it means to be a successful social worker, rather than what you truly want for yourself.
           What would be the first thing you would do if you didn't have to worry about meeting
           someone else's expectations, whether it's your own or others'?


[4]

Patient: If I didn't have to worry about expectations... I don't know, maybe I'd just take a break.
         Not do anything for a while, just to figure out what I actually want. I feel like I've been
         on this constant grind, from school to work, and I haven't really had a moment to just be
         still and think. But then again, that feels selfish. I mean, there's always something more
         I could be doing, right? That's what I've always been taught and believed. I'm not even
         sure I know how to just take a break.

Therapist: That sense of feeling selfish about wanting a break is really interesting. What would
           happen if you gave yourself permission to take that break, just for a little while,
           without judgment? What would be the worst that could happen, and what might you gain from
           it?


[5]

Patient: If I took a break... I don't know, I guess the worst that could happen is that I'd feel
         guilty. Like I'm letting someone down, or just being lazy. But if I didn't feel that way,
         if I could just take a break without judgment... maybe I'd have some space to think, to
         figure out what I really want. Maybe I'd realize there's more to me than just my job. But
         it's hard to imagine not feeling guilty about it. It's like I'm supposed to be going all
         the time, you know? That is the part that makes me anxious.

Therapist: It sounds like the idea of taking a break is tied up with this sense of obligation to
           always be doing something. What would be the impact on your sense of self-worth if you
           were to let go of that obligation, just for a little while?


[6]

Patient: If I let go of that obligation, I think I'd feel lost at first. Like I said, my job is such
         a big part of my identity. But maybe if I could get past that initial feeling, I might
         actually feel...lighter? Like maybe my worth isn't all wrapped up in what I do, but in who
         I am. But that's the thing, I don't really know who that is yet. It's scary to think about.
         I've always had a approach of just keeping moving forward, it feels awkward and strange to
         think about stopping.

Therapist: That sense of feeling lost and uncertain about who you are without your job is really
           tough. What would it take for you to start exploring and getting to know yourself beyond
           your role as a social worker, without feeling like you're losing your sense of identity?


[7]

Patient: I think I'd need to find something that really interests me, something that I do just for
         me. Not for work, not for anyone else. But it's hard to even know where to start. I've been
         so focused on my career for so long, I don't even know what I like to do in my free time
         anymore. I guess I'd need to try a few things, see what sticks. But it feels risky, like I
         might realize I don't even know who I am at all.

Therapist: That sense of uncertainty is a big risk, but it's also an opportunity to discover new
           things about yourself. What if you were to approach this exploration as an experiment,
           rather than a search for a definitive answer? What would it look like to try a few
           things, see what you enjoy, and learn from the process, rather than needing to figure it
           all out right now?


[8]

Patient: An experiment? I guess that takes some of the pressure off. Like, I wouldn't have to commit
         to anything long term, just try things out. Maybe I could start with something small, like
         a hobby or a class. I've always kind of wanted to try painting, but I've never made time
         for it. Maybe I could start there?

Therapist: That sounds like a great place to start - trying out painting as a hobby. What would it
           mean for you to commit to trying painting for just a few weeks, without any expectation
           of becoming a great artist or achieving any specific outcome?


[9]

Patient: Committing to a few weeks of painting, just to give it a go... I'm not sure it would be
         easy for me not to have any expectations. I'm kind of hard on myself, I always want to do
         things well. But I guess that's the point, right? To just do it for fun, not to be perfect.
         I think maybe if I could enjoy the painting process without judging myself, I might learn
         something about who I am beyond work. I'm not sure it would be easy at first, but I think I
         could do that.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have - recognizing that it might be hard, but willing to try
           anyway. What would it mean for you to give yourself permission to make a mess, to not do
           it perfectly, and to enjoy the process of painting without judgment?


[10]

Patient: Giving myself permission to make a mess... that's tough. I like things to be orderly, done
         right. But maybe that's part of the problem, always wanting things to be perfect. Maybe if
         I could just let go a bit, I could actually enjoy the process without constantly feeling
         like I'm not measuring up somehow. I guess it would feel kind of liberating to not judge
         myself so harshly. But I'm really not sure where to start.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already getting a sense of what it might be like to let go of
           self-judgment, and it feels liberating. What if you were to start by setting up a space
           for painting that's just for you, where you can be messy and imperfect, and see what
           happens?


[11]

Patient: I guess I could clear out a corner of my apartment, get some cheap supplies to start with.
         But what if I hate it? What if I spend all that time and money and it's just not for me? I
         don't want to waste resources. I guess that's part of the experiment though, right? Trying
         it out, seeing what happens. I just wish I could know for sure before I start.

Therapist: That's a great point about the experiment - it's okay to not know what will happen. And
           you're right, trying it out and seeing what happens is the only way to really find out.
           What if you were to reframe your thinking around the possibility of not enjoying
           painting, not as a waste of resources, but as an opportunity to learn what you don't like
           and what you might want to try instead?


[12]

Patient: Okay, I think I see what you're saying. So, if I try painting and I hate it, it's not a
         failure, it's just information. It's not a waste, because at least I'll know, and I can try
         something else. I guess that takes some of the pressure off. But it's still hard to not
         want to know for sure before I start.

Therapist: That's a big step forward - seeing the value in using uncertainty as a source of
           information rather than a source of fear. What if you were to commit to trying painting
           for a set amount of time, say a week or two, and then re-evaluate, rather than putting
           too much pressure on yourself to know for sure what will happen right now?


[13]

Patient: Alright, I think I can do that. I think I can commit to painting, maybe just for a couple
         of hours each week. I'll try that for two weeks, and then I can decide if I want to keep
         going or try something else. It's just an experiment, like you said. It's just really hard
         for me to not imagine all the "what if's" you know, what if I don't like it, what if I
         don't finish anything, what if I don't stick to the plan. It's tough to turn off my mind
         from worrying about all these unknowns, but I guess I have to start somewhere. So, yeah, I
         can commit to that.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step by committing to trying painting, and it's okay
           that your mind is still going to worry about all the "what-ifs". What if you were to
           allow yourself to have those worries, but also commit to showing up to paint each week,
           regardless of what your mind is saying?


[14]

Patient: Easier said than done, but I get what you're saying. So, I'll acknowledge the worries, but
         not let them stop me. I can do that. I think. I mean, I can at least try. Like you said, it
         doesn't have to be perfect.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making a lot of progress here. What if you were to remind yourself
           each week, before you start painting, that it's okay to have worries, and that you're
           showing up to paint anyway, not in spite of your worries, but because you value the
           process and the possibility of discovery?


[15]

Patient: Okay, I can do that. I can remind myself that it's okay to have worries, and that I'm
         choosing to show up anyway. I guess it's all about the way I frame it in my mind. But I
         don't know, it's still hard to not want to just give in to the worries. But I guess I can
         try to be kind of kind to myself about it. It's a work in progress.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have - recognizing that this is a process and that you're
           doing the best you can. What if you were to treat yourself with the same kindness and
           compassion that you would offer to a friend who's struggling with similar worries?


[16]

Patient: That's tough. I'm always pretty hard on myself. But I guess I would tell a friend that it's
         okay to have setbacks, that they're not failing if they struggle. I guess I can try to tell
         myself that too. It feels weird, but I'll try it.

Therapist: That's a great start. What if you were to write down some kind and compassionate things
           you'd say to a friend in a situation like this, and then read them to yourself when
           you're feeling hard on yourself?


[17]

Patient: Alright, I think I can do that. I can write down what I would say to other people and use
         that for myself. I guess I would say things like, "It's okay to have off days," or "You're
         doing the best you can, and that's enough." It feels a bit weird to think about saying that
         to myself, but maybe if I see it written down it will feel more real. I can try that and
         maybe over time, it won't feel as awkward.

Therapist: That's a great plan. What if you were to make a commitment to reading those phrases to
           yourself every day, maybe even just for a minute or two, to start with?


[18]

Patient: Every day? That feels like a lot. I don't know if I'm ready for that. Maybe I could start
         with a few times a week, like when I'm getting ready to paint. I think I could do that. I
         want to be more kind to myself but I think every day might be too much pressure for me.

Therapist: That sounds like a great compromise. Starting with a few times a week, like when you're
           getting ready to paint, is a great way to begin incorporating self-compassion into your
           routine. What if you were to commit to that for the next week or two, and then
           re-evaluate how it's going?


[19]

Patient: Okay, I can do that. A few times a week, when I'm getting ready to paint. And then I'll see
         how it's going after a week or two. That feels more doable. I just don't want to make
         promises to myself that I can't keep, you know?

Therapist: That's a really healthy attitude to have. What if you were to celebrate your commitment
           to showing up to paint and practicing self-compassion, even if it's just a small step,
           and acknowledge that that's a big deal?


[20]

Patient: That feels weird. Celebrate? It's not like I've done anything big. But I guess it is a
         step. I don't know. Maybe I can just acknowledge that I'm trying. That's something, right?
         I'm trying and not giving into the worry. Maybe that's enough for now.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Acknowledging that you're trying and not giving in to
           worry is a huge accomplishment, and that's definitely something to be proud of. What if
           you were to write down that acknowledgment, just for yourself, as a reminder of your
           progress?
