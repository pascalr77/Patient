# Transcript T46

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really struggling with anxiety in social
         settings. It's got to the point where I often just avoid seeing friends. I can manage
         alright with colleagues, as they know me pretty well, I suppose. But after work, it's been
         pretty isolating.

Therapist: What do you think is the main difference between how you interact with your colleagues
           and your friends that makes the former feel more comfortable for you?


[2]

Patient: Well, with colleagues, we have a clear topic to discuss - work. It's structured, I know
         what to expect. With friends, it's more open-ended. I never know what we'll talk about, or
         if I'll have anything interesting to add. Plus, I've known my colleagues for years, we've
         got a rhythm. Most of my friends are newer, or I've not seen them in ages due to my
         avoiding gatherings. It's like I'm on the outside looking in, you know?

Therapist: That feeling of being on the outside looking in sounds really tough. What does it do for
           you to feel like you're not fully connected with your friends?


[3]

Patient: It's lonely, for sure. But it's more than that. It's like I'm constantly playing catch-up,
         trying to figure out what's been happening in their lives. I miss the inside jokes, the
         shared memories. It's exhausting, to be honest. And the more time I spend away from them,
         the more anxious I get about seeing them again. It's a vicious cycle.

Therapist: What do you think this anxiety about seeing your friends is trying to protect you from,
           exactly?


[4]

Patient: Not sure I follow. Isn't anxiety just worry run amok? I guess maybe it's trying to protect
         me from saying something stupid, or being judged. But rationally, I know my friends aren't
         out to get me. It's just... it's like my brain goes into overdrive, and suddenly,
         everyone's a critic, ready to pounce on my every word.

Therapist: What would you be doing for yourself if you didn't have this inner critic constantly
           judging your words and actions in social situations?


[5]

Patient: If I didn't have that inner critic, I suppose I'd be more relaxed. More present, maybe. I'd
         probably enjoy myself more, not overthink every little thing. I might even look forward to
         socializing instead of dreading it. But that's a big if. That critic's been with me a long
         time.

Therapist: What's one thing you value about being present and enjoying social interactions, beyond
           just feeling relaxed or having fun?


[6]

Patient: I guess it would be the connection. Feeling like I'm part of the group, that I belong. It's
         not just about having a good time, it's about sharing an experience with others. That's
         something I miss, something I value. I just don't know how to get there anymore.

Therapist: What would be the first small step you could take to start moving towards feeling more
           connected and like you belong with your friends, even if it's just for a short time?


[7]

Patient: I suppose I could start by just reaching out more, maybe text or call rather than just
         liking a post here and there. Maybe suggest a low-key meet-up, like a coffee or something.
         Not a big group thing, just one or two friends at a time. Baby steps, right? I don't know.
         It's still nerve-wracking, but maybe it's a start.

Therapist: You're right, it's a start, and it's a brave one. What would you say to yourself to
           encourage yourself to take this first step, when the anxiety starts to creep in?


[8]

Patient: I'd probably say something like, "It's just coffee. You can leave anytime. But maybe, just
         maybe, it'll be okay. You won't know unless you try." I might also remind myself that these
         are my friends. They know I'm not some witty social butterfly. They like me anyway. For
         some reason.

Therapist: Let's make a plan to take that first step. When and with whom would you like to schedule
           that coffee meeting, and what specific action can you commit to taking in the next 24
           hours to make it happen?


[9]

Patient: Alright, I guess I could start with my friend Sarah. She's always been pretty
         understanding. Let's say coffee this weekend. In the next 24 hours, I'll send her a text.
         Just a simple, "Hey, it's been a while. Up for a coffee this weekend?" Something like that.
         No big deal, right?

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. When you send that text, what's one thing you'll do to
           take care of yourself in case Sarah says no or can't meet up?


[10]

Patient: If Sarah says no, I guess I'll just remind myself that it's not personal. People get busy,
         have other plans. It's not a reflection on me. Maybe I'll also plan something nice for
         myself, like watch a movie I've been meaning to see or order takeout from that new place.
         Something to look forward to, just in case.

Therapist: That's a great way to approach it. It sounds like you're learning to take care of
           yourself, regardless of the outcome. Can you imagine what it might be like to have a few
           of these small successes under your belt, where you reach out to friends and it goes
           well?


[11]

Patient: Yeah, maybe. I mean, it's hard to imagine right now. But maybe if it goes well a few times,
         I'd feel less nervous about reaching out. Maybe I'd even start to look forward to it. But
         let's not get ahead of ourselves. One step at a time, right? I'll believe it when I see it.

Therapist: That's a really wise approach. Let's focus on that first step, sending the text to Sarah.
           What's the one thing you can do right now to make sure you follow through on that plan?


[12]

Patient: I can set a reminder on my phone to send the text in an hour. That way, I won't chicken out
         or "forget" I appreciate the help with making a plan, but let's see how it goes, yeah?

Therapist: You're absolutely taking care of yourself by setting that reminder. I'm confident you'll
           send that text and take the first step towards reconnecting with Sarah. Is there anything
           else you'd like to talk about before we wrap up today's session?


[13]

Patient: Not really. I think that's enough for now. I'll see how this goes with Sarah. Thanks for
         the help with making a plan.

Therapist: It was my pleasure to work with you. Remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time
           and to be kind to yourself throughout the process. You've got this.


[14]

Patient: Yeah, okay. One step at a time. I can do that. Thanks. Talk to you later.

Therapist: Sounds good, take care of yourself and have a good day.


[15]

Patient: You too. Bye.

Therapist: Goodbye.


[16]

Patient: Bye.

Therapist: Goodbye.


[17]

Patient: Yeah, bye. We'll see how this goes.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling more hopeful about taking the next step. That's a great
           place to start.


[18]

Patient: Maybe. I just want to see if I can do this.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. It's about taking small steps and seeing what works for
           you.


[19]

Patient: I guess. We'll see. I'm not counting my chickens before they hatch or anything. Just gonna
         send the text and go from there

Therapist: That's a very realistic and humble approach. Just taking it one step at a time and seeing
           what happens.


[20]

Patient: Exactly. No use getting ahead of myself. I'll just do what I can and go from there.

Therapist: That's a great way to approach it. Focus on what you can control and take things one step
           at a time.
