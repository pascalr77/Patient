Patient: Hi, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been struggling with my temper. I started a new
         teaching job this year, and the workload is immense. I find myself snapping at colleagues
         and even students, which isn't like me. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to manage
         my frustration. I feel like I am just not good enough to do this job.

Therapist: That feeling of not being good enough can be really tough, especially when it affects
           your relationships with colleagues and students. What specifically happens just before
           you snap at someone - is it a particular student's question, a task that's due, or
           something else entirely?


[2]

Patient: Usually it's when I'm overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to do. Like when a colleague
         asks me to do one more thing, or a student needs extra help and I'm already swamped. It's
         like I hit a wall and I just can't take anymore, so I lash out. It's not fair to them, I
         know, but it's like I can't control it. I do not want to be that kind of person but
         sometimes my patience runs out.

Therapist: It sounds like those moments of feeling overwhelmed can be really scary for you - like
           you're losing control of yourself. What do you think happens if you do lose control,
           what's the worst that might happen?


[3]

Patient: I guess I'm afraid I'll say something I can't take back, or worse, hurt someone
         emotionally. I don't want to be the teacher that everyone hates, or the colleague that no
         one wants to work with. It's like in those moments, I'm not myself. I'm just... a ball of
         rage. It is scary to think of myself in that way. I want to be a good teacher, a good
         colleague, but this anger is pushing people away.

Therapist: You mentioned being a 'ball of rage' - can you describe what that feels like, what it's
           like to be 'not yourself' in those moments?


[4]

Patient: It's like a hot wave crashing over me. My heart races, my muscles tense, and my mind goes
         blank. It's not that I want to be angry, I just can't help it. I don't feel like myself
         because it's like I'm watching someone else yell, someone else snap at a student or a
         colleague. I would never want to hurt anyone, but in those moments, it's like I can't stop
         myself. I have no control over my reactions.

Therapist: It sounds like you're deeply committed to being a compassionate teacher who doesn't want
           to hurt anyone. You mentioned being 'watching yourself' in those moments - can you tell
           me more about who you see yourself being, ideally, in those situations, and what that
           looks like in action?


[5]

Patient: I see myself as someone who's patient and understanding. I want to be the teacher who
         listens and supports students and colleagues. Ideally, instead of snapping, I want to be
         able to say, "I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, but I want to help. Let's find a solution
         together." But when the tension comes, it is not easy to control. It's not fair to blame
         others for how I feel, but I do not want to hurt anyone with my behavior. I just want to be
         a good teacher that everyone can rely on.

Therapist: You want to be honest about your feelings while also being considerate of others - that's
           a really important balance to strike. When you feel overwhelmed and want to say, "I'm a
           bit overwhelmed right now," what's the fear that might stop you from speaking up in that
           way, especially if you're worried about hurting others' feelings?


[6]

Patient: I guess I'm afraid of being seen as weak, or like I can't handle my job. As a teacher, I'm
         supposed to have it all together. I am the one who supports others, not the other way
         around. If I let them know I am overwhelmed, they might think I am not good enough. I do
         not want to burden them with my problems. It's a strange mix of fear and pride, I suppose.
         It's easier to be angry than to admit I'm struggling and risk disappointing others. Or even
         worse, they might see me as a failure..

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about being seen as a burden, and that's really tied to
           your sense of pride and identity as a capable teacher. What if you were to reframe being
           overwhelmed as a natural part of being a teacher, rather than a weakness - what would
           that mean for how you approach asking for help or being honest with others?


[7]

Patient: If it's not a weakness, then maybe it's just... a fact. Like, yes, I'm overwhelmed, and
         that's okay because it's a tough job. It doesn't make me a bad teacher. I guess, ideally,
         it would help me see that it's alright to ask for help. That I don't have to do everything
         alone. But it's hard to actually do that. It's tough to break out of that mindset of "I
         should be able to handle this."

Therapist: It sounds like there's a strong expectation on you to be self-sufficient, like you're the
           only one who can get everything done. But let's imagine for a moment that you're on a
           plane, and the oxygen masks drop down - what do the flight attendants always tell you to
           do in that situation?


[8]

Patient: They tell you to put your own mask on first before helping others. I get it, but it's hard
         to apply that to my life. I'm supposed to be the one helping others, not the one needing
         help. It feels selfish to focus on myself when there are kids who need my help or
         colleagues who are overwhelmed too. I am supposed to be their support system, not the other
         way around.

Therapist: You're deeply committed to being a support system for your students and colleagues, which
           is admirable. But what if not taking care of yourself first actually affects your ability
           to be that support system - would you want to be a drained and burnt-out teacher, or a
           healthy and energized one?


[9]

Patient: Of course, I'd rather be healthy and energized. But it's not that simple. I can't just flip
         a switch and put myself first. I've spent my whole career putting others first. It feels
         wrong to prioritize myself. I do not want to be selfish, I am here to help others and serve
         my students. But I see your point, maybe I need to strike a balance between helping myself
         and helping others.

Therapist: Being a good teacher doesn't mean you have to put others first at the expense of your own
           well-being - in fact, taking care of yourself can make you a better teacher. Can you
           imagine a scenario where you're able to set healthy boundaries and prioritize your own
           needs, not because you're being selfish, but because you're choosing to be the best
           version of yourself, which in turn benefits your students and colleagues?


[10]

Patient: I mean, yeah, I can imagine it, but it's hard to picture actually doing it. Like, I see
         myself saying, "I need to take a break and recharge so I can be refreshed for our class
         tomorrow." It feels strange even thinking about it. I am so used to giving all of myself to
         others. But maybe if I frame it as recharging to be a better teacher, it might be easier to
         accept.

Therapist: That's a great start - reframing it as recharging to be a better teacher. What's one
           small, manageable step you could take this week to start prioritizing your own needs,
           something that feels doable and doesn't require a huge shift, but might help you feel
           more energized for your students and colleagues?


[11]

Patient: Maybe I could set aside one hour each night just for myself. Like, put my school stuff away
         and read a book or take a walk. Just something to clear my mind. I could even set a timer
         to make sure I stick to it, and turn off notifications. One hour a day is a small step and
         not too much to ask for right? I could at least start there and see how it goes.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan - one hour a day can make a big difference in how you feel.
           By setting aside that time just for yourself, you might find that you're more patient
           with your students, more creative in your teaching, and more energized for your
           colleagues. Can you commit to giving this a try for the next week, and see how it affects
           your teaching and your well-being?


[12]

Patient: I can try. No promises, but I'll do my best to stick to it for a week. I mean, it's just an
         hour, right? I can always find excuses not to do it.

Therapist: You're right, it's just an hour, but it's a start. And it's not about making promises,
           it's about making a commitment to yourself. Can you say it out loud: "I commit to setting
           aside one hour each day, just for myself, starting now, for the next week"?


[13]

Patient: I commit to setting aside one hour each day, just for myself, starting now, for the next
         week. There, I said it. Now let's see if I can actually do it. I am not sure it will be
         easy for me to stick to it, but I will give it a shot.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage, and it's not about being perfect, it's about being committed
           to trying. Remember, the goal isn't just about setting aside an hour each day, it's about
           taking care of yourself and being a better teacher. What do you think you might learn
           about yourself and your values if you stick to this commitment for the next week?


[14]

Patient: I guess I'll see if I really can put myself first, even just for a little bit each day.
         Maybe I'll find out that it's not as hard as I thought. Or maybe I'll realize that this is
         not the right approach. Maybe I will see what taking care of myself really means and how it
         affects me. I am not sure what I will learn, but I hope it will be useful in some way.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have - being open to learning and growth. Remember, the goal
           is not to figure everything out right now, but to take small steps towards taking care of
           yourself. Be kind to yourself if you miss a day or two, and remember that it's okay to
           adjust your approach as needed. What if, instead of beating yourself up over mistakes,
           you simply acknowledged them and gently got back on track?


[15]

Patient: Easier said than done, but I get your point. I guess if I slip up, I could just say, "Okay,
         that happened, let's try again tomorrow." No use dwelling on it. Beating myself up won't
         make it better. I just need to be kind to myself and keep moving forward. I do not want to
         make promises I can't keep, but I will try to do better.

Therapist: That's a beautiful shift in perspective - from beating yourself up to being kind and
           moving forward. What if being kind to yourself becomes a non-negotiable part of who you
           are, not just something you try to do when you slip up? Can you imagine making kindness
           towards yourself a core value, something that guides your actions and decisions?


[16]

Patient: I don't know if I can make it a core value just yet, but I can try to be more mindful of
         it. I mean, it's not like I can just flip a switch and suddenly be kind to myself all the
         time. But maybe if I keep practicing it, it'll become more natural. I am not sure how it
         will turn out, but I do want to be a better teacher and a better person, so it is worth a
         shot. I do not want to give up on myself, but I do not want to put too much pressure on
         myself either.

Therapist: That's a great approach - being mindful of kindness towards yourself and taking it one
           step at a time. Remember, self-compassion is not about being perfect, it's about being
           gentle and understanding with yourself as you work towards your goals. What if, by being
           kind to yourself, you actually increase your motivation and effort to be a better teacher
           and person?


[17]

Patient: I guess that could happen. I mean, if I'm not so hard on myself, maybe I'll have more
         energy to put into teaching and helping others. It's just a weird concept for me, you know?
         Being kind to myself feels... selfish, I guess. But I'm willing to give it a try and see
         what happens. I do not want to feel guilty about it, but it is hard not to.

Therapist: It's understandable that it feels weird at first, given how we're often socialized to put
           others first. But what if being kind to yourself is actually a way of being a better
           teacher and person, rather than a selfish act? Think about it - when you're kind to
           yourself, you're more patient, more energized, and more able to help others. Can you see
           how being self-compassionate might actually be a key part of being a good teacher, rather
           than something separate from it?


[18]

Patient: Maybe. I guess if I'm not running on empty, I'll have more to give to my students. But it's
         still hard to wrap my head around. I've always thought that being a good teacher means
         putting students first, always. It is just very different from what I am used to. I am not
         sure how to change my mindset, but I will try.

Therapist: That's a great insight - being a good teacher doesn't mean sacrificing yourself, but
           rather finding a balance that allows you to be your best self for your students. What if
           your identity as a teacher is not just about putting students first, but about being a
           compassionate, patient, and effective educator who can bring out the best in them? Can
           you imagine what that might look like, and how it might feel to be that kind of teacher?


[19]

Patient: I think it would feel... good. Like, I'd be proud of myself, instead of always feeling like
         I'm falling short. I'd be able to really listen to my students, and help them grow. I might
         even enjoy teaching more, if I'm not always so stressed and overwhelmed. But it's hard to
         imagine right now, when I'm just trying to keep my head above water. I do not want to be a
         teacher who is always stressed, but I do want to be a good teacher.

Therapist: It's amazing how much of a difference it can make to feel proud of yourself and enjoy
           your work. What if taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself is not a luxury,
           but a necessary part of being a successful and sustainable teacher in the long run?


[20]

Patient: I guess that makes sense. I just never thought of it that way. I always saw self-care as
         something extra, not essential. But if it means I can teach better and longer, maybe it is
         necessary. I do not want to burn out, but I do not want to be selfish either. It's a tricky
         balance to strike.

Therapist: You're right, it's a tricky balance to strike, but it's one that's worth exploring. What
           if you were to ask yourself, before every decision, "Is this choice in line with my
           values of being a compassionate and effective teacher, and is it taking care of myself
           and my well-being?"
