# Transcript T38

[1]

Patient: I've been out of work for a while now, and I just can't seem to get started on finding a
         new job. I keep worrying about what if I can't perform well enough in a new job.  It's like
         I'm stuck in a rut, knowing I should be doing something, but I end up putting it off all
         the time.

Therapist: What specific aspects of performing well in a new job are you most worried about? Is it
           making a good impression, meeting expectations, or something else?


[2]

Patient: I'm worried about so many things. Meeting expectations, that's a big one. What if I can't
         learn the new tasks quickly enough? What if I make mistakes? I don't want to look foolish
         in front of younger colleagues, either. I feel like I should know everything already but in
         reality, I don't. It's all just very overwhelming.

Therapist: You feel like you should know everything already, but you don't. Can you tell me more
           about what it's like to feel like you're not meeting this expectation of being an expert
           or knowing it all?


[3]

Patient: It's frustrating, really. I've been around for so long, I feel like I should have all the
         answers by now. It's like I'm letting myself down, not meeting my own standards. I see all
         these young folks, so confident and quick to pick things up, and I think, "Why can't I do
         that?" It makes me feel... inadequate, I suppose. Makes me wonder if I truly have what it
         takes to compete with all the young people.

Therapist: What's the idea behind comparing yourself to these younger colleagues? What's at stake
           for you if you can't measure up to them?


[4]

Patient: I just feel like if I can't keep up with them, then what's the point? The world is moving
         so fast, technology and all, and if I can't stay ahead or at least keep up, then I might as
         well just throw in the towel, I guess. I worry if I can't measure up, then I'll just be
         thrown on the scrap heap. It's like I'm trying to prove to myself and everyone else that
         I've still got value, that I'm not just some old fossil. I just can't bear the thought of
         not pulling my weight or not being good at something, even if it's new.

Therapist: What does being "good at something" or "pulling your weight" mean to you? What kind of
           person do you want to be, beyond just a professional?


[5]

Patient: Well, being good at something means doing it right the first time, not having to ask for
         help or clarification. It's being reliable, independent. Pulling my weight? That's about
         being someone others can count on, not a burden, I suppose. Beyond work, I guess I want to
         be useful, to have a purpose, to feel like I still have something to offer to the world, to
         my family. I just want to be someone who others look up to and respect. I'm not sure I want
         to be the kind of person who's always asking for help or needing special attention, I just
         want to be steady, reliable, and capable until the day I die.

Therapist: Given these values of being reliable, capable, and respected, what would be the first
           small step you could take today or this week to move closer to living in alignment with
           these values, even if it's not in a new job right away?


[6]

Patient: I'm not sure, really. That all sounds great in theory but it seems harder than ever to
         actually put into action. I guess maybe I could start by doing something useful around the
         house? Maybe finally tackle that leaky faucet or organize the garage? I've been putting
         those off for a while. It's not a job, but it's something, I suppose. I just don't want to
         get overwhelmed and bogged down again. It's hard to find the motivation sometimes even for
         the little things, honestly.

Therapist: You mentioned that doing something useful around the house is a step towards living in
           alignment with your values. What if, instead of focusing on getting everything done
           perfectly, you simply focus on showing up and taking one small action towards fixing that
           leaky faucet or organizing the garage each day? What would that look like, and how might
           that give you a sense of purpose and motivation?


[7]

Patient: You make it sound so simple. I don't know, I guess I could just gather the tools for the
         faucet or maybe sort one box in the garage. I'm not sure if it would feel like enough,
         though. I don't want to just do it halfway. If I can't do it all at once, maybe I should
         wait until I can. I just want to be the kind of person that can jump in and do what needs
         to be done, not someone who piddles around the edges.

Therapist: What if, instead of waiting until you can do it perfectly, you focus on the value of
           taking action, even if it's imperfect? What if showing up and taking small steps towards
           fixing the faucet or organizing the garage, even if it's not done to your liking, is
           actually a way of being the kind of person you want to be, rather than a way of being
           someone who piddles around the edges?


[8]

Patient: I see your point, I suppose, but it's hard to shake the feeling that if it's not done
         right, it's not worth doing. I don't want to just move things around in the garage and then
         have to go back and do it again because I didn't do it right the first time, you know? But
         maybe, just maybe, getting started is better than nothing.

Therapist: When you think "it's not worth doing if it's not done right," what's the thought that
           comes after that? Is it something like "I'll never be able to do it right, so why even
           try"?


[9]

Patient: Yeah, pretty much. It's like I can see all the ways it could go wrong, all the ways I might
         mess it up, and then I think, "What's the use? It's just going to end up a mess anyway."
         It's easier to just not start, honestly, to avoid the disappointment altogether. It's like
         I'm frozen, stuck, and I just can't see a way out of it sometimes.

Therapist: When you think "it's just going to end up a mess anyway," what's the thought that's
           driving that prediction? Is it a thought about yourself, or is it a thought about the
           situation?


[10]

Patient: It's about me. It's like, I think "I'll make a mess of it because I always do." I look back
         at all the times I've tried and failed, and I think, "What makes this time any different?"
         It's hard to shake that feeling, you know? It's like I'm destined to repeat the same
         mistakes over and over again.

Therapist: What would happen if you took a step back from that self-criticism and said, "I've made
           mistakes in the past, but that doesn't mean I'll make them again"? What if, instead of
           predicting failure, you focused on what you can learn from those past experiences and how
           you can apply that to this new situation?


[11]

Patient: Easier said than done. I hear what you're saying, but it's hard to believe that I won't
         just repeat the same old mistakes. I guess if I could just take a breath and say, "Okay,
         what can I do differently this time?" instead of assuming the worst... I don't know, maybe
         I could at least get started, give it a shot. But it's hard to shake that feeling of just
         knowing I'll mess it up again. It's like I'm programmed that way, you know?

Therapist: Let's try an experiment. When you're thinking "I'll just mess it up again," can you
           imagine saying to yourself, "Ah, there's the thought 'I'll mess it up again.' I'm having
           the thought that I'll mess it up again." Just observe the thought, without judgment, and
           then take a step back. What do you notice?


[12]

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. "Ah, there's the thought 'I'll mess it up again.' I'm having
         the thought that I'll mess it up again." Well, I notice that it's just a thought, not a
         fact. It's not something that's definitely going to happen, just because I thought it. I
         guess it makes it feel a little less overwhelming, a little less true, even. It's like I
         can see it for what it is, just a thought, not my destiny.

Therapist: What if you were to take this newfound awareness with you into other areas of your life,
           like when you're feeling anxious about a new job or uncertain about your abilities? Could
           you imagine saying to yourself, "Ah, there's the thought 'I'm not good enough.' I'm
           having the thought that I'm not good enough." How might that change your experience in
           those situations?


[13]

Patient: Yeah, I can imagine it. It would probably help me take a step back, maybe calm down a bit.
         Instead of just spinning in circles with the worry, I could maybe see it for what it is -
         just a thought, not a fact. Maybe it would help me to not just get swept up in the feeling
         of not being good enough, to not just accept it as true right off the bat. But it's hard,
         you know? Those feelings are so strong sometimes, it's hard to remember to take a step
         back. But I think, maybe, if I can keep practicing it, it might help.

Therapist: What small, daily action could you take to reinforce this new skill, like writing it
           down, saying it out loud, or sharing it with a friend?


[14]

Patient: I'm not much for sharing my feelings with others, and I don't want to burden my friends
         with this stuff. But maybe I could just make a note of it when I catch myself having one of
         those thoughts. Like, write it down in a little notebook or something, just to help me
         remember to take a step back. I don't know if I'll remember to do it every time, but maybe
         if I try to make a habit of it, it'll get easier. I could start with just trying to do it
         once a day, maybe first thing in the morning, so I'm ready for whatever comes my way.

Therapist: That sounds like a great start. What if, as you write down these thoughts and take a step
           back, you also ask yourself what you're hoping to gain from this experience, what you're
           trying to achieve by taking action, or what kind of person you want to become? How might
           that shift your focus and motivation?


[15]

Patient: I see what you're getting at, but it's hard to think that way. I'm not really sure what I
         want to achieve, besides not feeling like this anymore. But maybe, if I can start to see
         these thoughts for what they are, I can start to think more about what I want, not just
         what I don't want. Maybe I want to be more confident, more sure of myself. I want to be the
         kind of person who can handle whatever comes my way. But that's a tall order, isn't it? I
         don't know if I can just suddenly become that person.

Therapist: What if, instead of aiming to become a completely different person, you focus on taking
           one small step towards confidence and self-assurance, like doing one thing that makes you
           feel slightly more capable or competent each day? What's one thing you could do today to
           take a tiny step in that direction?


[16]

Patient: Alright, I see your point. Maybe I don't have to become a whole new person overnight. But
         just one thing a day? I don't know, it's still kinda hard to think of something. I guess I
         could maybe look at that leaky faucet again, maybe just gather the tools and read up on how
         to fix it. It's not much, but it's something, I suppose.

Therapist: What if, by fixing that leaky faucet, you're not just fixing a physical problem, but also
           developing a sense of capability and confidence that can translate to other areas of your
           life? How might that change your perspective on what's possible for you?


[17]

Patient: Well, I hadn't thought of it that way. I guess if I can fix that faucet, maybe I can do
         other things too. It's not just about the faucet, but about knowing I can handle things,
         figure things out. Maybe it's a step, you know? Maybe it's not so much about the one thing
         I'm doing, but what it means for everything else. But it's still hard to believe that it
         could really make a difference. I guess I won't know until I try, though.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to believe in your ability to handle things, you focus on the
           fact that you've already taken many steps in the past to get to where you are today? What
           if you trusted that you have a reservoir of capabilities and strengths that can be drawn
           upon, even if you're not aware of them yet?


[18]

Patient: That's a tall order, trusting in something I can't see or feel. But I guess I have made it
         through a lot, haven't I? I've raised a family, had a career. I suppose that took some
         doing. I don't know if I can just suddenly trust that I have some hidden reservoir of
         strength, but maybe, maybe I can look back and see that I've done more than I give myself
         credit for. It's hard to see it that way, though. It's easy to just look at all the places
         I've fallen short.

Therapist: What if, instead of dwelling on the places where you've fallen short, you started to keep
           a "resume" or a list of your past accomplishments and strengths? What if you celebrated
           and acknowledged each of these achievements, no matter how small they may seem, as
           evidence of your capabilities and resilience?


[19]

Patient: You make it sound so easy. I can't just ignore the places I've fallen short, can I? But I
         see what you're getting at. I guess I could try writing some things down. I'm not one to
         toot my own horn, but maybe, just for myself, I could make a little list. I don't know if
         it'll make me feel any better, but I suppose it's worth a shot. I can think of a few
         things, maybe. I guess that's a start, isn't it?

Therapist: What if, as you continue to write down your accomplishments and strengths, you also
           started to ask yourself what kind of person you want to be in relation to these things?
           What kind of person is worthy of celebrating and acknowledging their strengths?


[20]

Patient: I don't know if I'm the kind of person who can just celebrate myself, honestly. It feels a
         bit selfish, don't you think? But I guess if I want to be more confident, maybe I should
         try to be more appreciative of what I've done. I don't know, it's not how I was raised,
         tooting my own horn and all. But maybe, just maybe, I can try to see the good in what I've
         done, not just the bad. It's hard to even imagine what kind of person that would be,
         though. I guess I'll have to give it some thought.

Therapist: What if, instead of thinking of it as "tooting your own horn," you thought of it as
           taking care of yourself and acknowledging your own worth? Would that make it feel any
           more acceptable to you to celebrate your strengths and accomplishments?
