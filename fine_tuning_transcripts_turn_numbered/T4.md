# Transcript T4

[1]

Patient: I've been struggling lately with going to any kind of social gathering. I get really
         anxious whenever I think about being around people, even friends and family. It's been so
         bad that I've just been avoiding them altogether. I'm not really sure what to do about it.

Therapist: What's one specific thing that you worry will happen when you're around friends and
           family that makes you feel anxious?


[2]

Patient: I worry that I'll say or do something stupid, and that they'll judge me or think less of
         me. It's like I can feel their eyes on me, waiting for me to mess up. I just can't stand
         the thought of them pitying me or thinking I'm incompetent, especially since I've been
         having a hard time finding a job.

Therapist: What do you think would happen to your sense of self if people actually did judge you for
           struggling to find a job?


[3]

Patient: I don't know. I guess I feel like I'd see myself as more of a failure. I've always been
         able to take care of myself and my family, but now... I don't know, it's like I'm letting
         everyone down. I don't want people to look at me differently, like I'm some sort of charity
         case. It's just... it's hard to explain. I just want to be seen as capable, I guess.

Therapist: What does it mean to you to be seen as capable, and is that something that's deeply
           important to who you are as a person?


[4]

Patient: It means being able to handle stuff on my own, not having to rely on others. It's always
         been important to me, ever since I was a kid. I never wanted to be a burden, you know? I
         wanted to be the one people could count on. But now, with the job stuff... it's like I'm
         losing that. Like I'm losing a part of myself. It's not just about what others think, it's
         about how I see myself.

Therapist: Can you imagine a scenario where you're not defined by your job or your current
           situation, but by other qualities or strengths you possess?


[5]

Patient: Not really, no. I've always been the provider, the responsible one. If I'm not that, then
         who am I? It's not like I've got any hobbies or special talents. I don't see what else
         there is to define me. I just can't separate who I am from what I do, or did, I guess. It's
         all tied up together.

Therapist: What are the things in life that you value most deeply, like what's most important to you
           in relationships, in community, or in how you live your life?


[6]

Patient: I value loyalty, honesty. Being there for people when they need you, not just when it's
         convenient. I value hard work, pulling your own weight. I guess I just see life as being
         about doing what needs to be done, not making a big fuss about it. Just being steady and
         reliable. That's what's important to me. That's how I've always tried to live.

Therapist: How might your values of loyalty, honesty, and hard work guide you in how you show up to
           your relationships and interactions, even when it's hard or uncomfortable, like when
           you're feeling anxious about social gatherings?


[7]

Patient: I don't know. I guess I try to be there for people even when it's hard. Like, if someone
         needs help moving or something, I'll show up, even if I'm feeling anxious. I might not stay
         long, but I'll be there. I try to be honest about what I can and can't do. I just... I
         don't know how to be around people just to socialize. It feels useless, I guess. Like,
         what's the point if I'm not doing anything productive? But I do try to be there for the
         people that matter to me, even when it's not easy.

Therapist: What if being around people, even just to socialize, wasn't about being productive in the
           classical sense, but about showing up to the people who matter to you and being present
           in their lives, even if it feels "useless" in the moment?


[8]

Patient: Never really thought about it that way. I guess I always figure, if I'm not doing something
         tangible, what's the point? But if just being there counts for something, I don't know.
         It's hard to wrap my head around. I'd still feel anxious, but maybe... maybe I'd feel a bit
         better knowing I'm doing something for someone else. Even if it's just listening or
         something.

Therapist: What's a small, low-stakes social situation that you might feel comfortable showing up
           to, even if it's just for a little while, like meeting a friend for coffee or going for a
           walk with a neighbor?


[9]

Patient: I guess meeting up with an old friend might be okay. Someone I've known for a long time,
         who knows me well. Maybe just for a coffee, somewhere quiet. I wouldn't want to stay long,
         but I think I could handle that. As long as it's not a big group or anything. Just one on
         one.

Therapist: That sounds like a great starting point. Meeting your friend for a quiet coffee might be
           a good way to get your feet wet, so to speak. What would you need to feel prepared for
           this meeting, like what would make you feel more confident or less anxious about it?


[10]

Patient: I don't know. I guess knowing what we're going to talk about ahead of time would help. I
         hate small talk. Maybe if I had something specific to ask him about, or if I knew he wanted
         to talk about something in particular. That way, I wouldn't feel so on the spot. I could
         prepare, you know? Have something to focus on.

Therapist: That makes sense, wanting to feel prepared. But what if you were to approach this meeting
           not with a specific agenda or topic in mind, but rather with an openness to seeing what
           unfolds in the moment? What if you were to focus on being present with your friend,
           rather than trying to control the conversation or the outcome?


[11]

Patient: I don't know if I can do that. I mean, I'm not good with surprises. I like to know what's
         coming. That's why I like to have a plan. But I guess... I guess I could try. Maybe just
         start with something simple, like asking how he's been. I can do that. But no promises. I
         just don't want to feel stupid or unprepared.

Therapist: Asking how your friend has been is a great starting point. And you know what? It's okay
           if you don't know what to say next. You can always take a pause, breathe, and ask another
           question. The goal isn't to be perfect or to have all the answers, but to show up and be
           present with your friend. Can you try to let go of the need to have a plan, just for this
           one question, and see what happens?


[12]

Patient: I can try. But no promises. I just don't want to freeze up or say something dumb. But yeah,
         I can ask how he's been and then... I guess I'll just see what happens next. One step at a
         time, right?

Therapist: That's exactly right, one step at a time. And remember, it's not about being perfect or
           saying something profound, it's about showing up and being present. Celebrate that you're
           taking this small step, and we can build on it from here. What do you think is the next
           small step you could take after meeting with your friend?


[13]

Patient: I don't know. I guess maybe I could think about meeting up with someone else after that.
         Not a big deal, just another coffee or something. Maybe someone I haven't seen in a while.
         But I don't want to get ahead of myself. Let's just see how this first one goes. I'm not
         making any promises.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Let's focus on one step at a time, and see how it goes.
           Meeting up with someone else can be a great next step, but let's not put too much
           pressure on it. Just focus on enjoying the moment and being present with your friend. And
           remember, every small step you take towards facing your anxiety is a victory.


[14]

Patient: Yeah, okay. I can do that. Just focus on this one thing first. And if it goes okay, then
         maybe I can think about the next step. But no rush. I get it.

Therapist: That's exactly right. Take it one step at a time, and don't worry about the next step
           until you get to it. Just focus on showing up and being present with your friend. I'm
           proud of you for being willing to take this small step, and I'm here to support you as
           you continue to move forward.


[15]

Patient: Thanks. I guess we'll see how it goes. I just don't want to make a big deal out of it, you
         know? It's just a coffee. But it's a start, I guess. We'll see.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Just take it as it comes, and remember that every small
           step counts. You're taking a chance, and that's a big deal in itself. We'll take it from
           here, one step at a time.


[16]

Patient: Yeah, okay. One step at a time. I can do that. Let's just see how this goes first. I don't
         wanna jump ahead. I need to take this at my own pace.

Therapist: That's exactly right. You're in control here, and you get to set the pace. Take your
           time, and don't feel like you need to rush into anything. Just focus on showing up and
           being present with your friend, and see what happens from there.


[17]

Patient: Alright. I can do that. Just show up, be there. No big deal. And if it sucks, I don't have
         to do it again.

Therapist: Exactly. You're not committing to anything long-term, just showing up for this one
           interaction. And even if it doesn't go as planned, that's okay. You can always try again
           or try something different. But for now, just focus on being present and taking care of
           yourself.


[18]

Patient: Yeah. Okay. I think I can handle that. Thanks. I just need to take this one step at a time.
         See how it goes.

Therapist: It was great working with you today. Remember, taking it one step at a time is a process,
           and it's okay to take your time. You're making progress, and that's something to be proud
           of. Keep going at your own pace, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further
           support. Take care of yourself.


[19]

Patient: Thanks. I will. I guess I did okay today. We'll see how the rest goes. Take care.

Therapist: You did great today, and I'm proud of you for facing your fears and taking small steps
           towards change. I'll be here whenever you're ready to take the next step. Take care of
           yourself and take care of that coffee date!


[20]

Patient: Yeah, yeah. I will. Thanks. I'll be in touch.

Therapist: Sounds good. It was great working with you. I'm looking forward to hearing how things go.
           Take care, and I'll talk to you soon.
