# Transcript T40

[1]

Patient: Hi, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really struggling with these cycles of being
         too hard on myself. I feel like I've not achieved what I should have, and I can't help but
         blame myself. I think it might have something to do with my upbringing, it was a bit
         chaotic, you know?

Therapist: What are some of the specific things you feel you should have achieved, but haven't, that
           trigger this self-blame?


[2]

Patient: Well, it's a lot of things, really. Like, I should have a stable job by now, maybe even a
         career. I should probably have my own place, not still be living with roommates. And I
         guess I thought I'd be more successful in general, you know? I feel like everyone around me
         is moving forward and I'm just...stuck. It's not that I don't try, I do. It's
         just...nothing seems to work out for me.

Therapist: When you say everyone else seems to be moving forward, what is it about their progress
           that makes you feel like you're stuck?


[3]

Patient: I see people my age with these great jobs, or getting married, or even just having their
         own apartment. They seem so sure of what they're doing, like they have it all figured out.
         And then there's me, still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, feeling
         like I'm way behind. It's like I'm watching a movie of their lives, but mine is on pause.

Therapist: What do you get out of watching these people's lives, or feeling like you're watching a
           movie of theirs, while yours is paused?


[4]

Patient: Honestly, it makes me feel pretty bad about myself. Like I'm failing in comparison. But at
         the same time, it's almost comforting in a weird way? Like, if I'm focused on what they're
         doing, I don't have to think about my own stuff as much. It's kind of a distraction. But
         then I end up feeling worse about myself later, so it's not even worth it. It's all just
         really confusing.

Therapist: What are you trying to avoid or protect by distracting yourself with others' lives,
           rather than focusing on your own?


[5]

Patient: I don't know, really. Maybe I'm just trying to avoid feeling like a failure? Like if I
         don't think about my own life, then I don't have to face how badly I've messed it up. It's
         like I'm stuck in this place where I want to move forward, but I'm also terrified of even
         trying. So instead, I just focus on other people and how great their lives seem.

Therapist: What would moving forward, or making progress in your life, look like for you in terms of
           values or goals?


[6]

Patient: I guess moving forward would look like me having some kind of direction. Maybe a job that I
         actually care about, or at least one that pays the bills. I'd like to be able to support
         myself, not depend on others so much. It's not even about having a ton of money or
         anything, just...stability. And maybe feeling like I have a purpose? Like I'm actually
         doing something meaningful with my life. But then again, I've had goals before and I always
         end up messing them up, so it's hard to even let myself want those things, you know?

Therapist: How do you think your past failures have contributed to your reluctance to set and work
           towards these goals now, especially the fear of messing them up again?


[7]

Patient: Well, every time I've tried to do something in the past, it's always ended badly. Like,
         I'll start a new job and then I'll make some stupid mistake and get fired. Or I'll try to
         go back to school, but then I can't keep up and I drop out. It's always the same pattern.
         So now, even when I think about trying something new, I just assume I'm going to fail. It's
         like, what's the point of even trying if I know it's not going to work out? It's just
         easier not to even start.

Therapist: What do you get out of assuming you'll fail, or expecting that things won't work out,
           before you've even tried?


[8]

Patient: I guess it feels safer, in a way. Like, if I expect the worst, then I won't be disappointed
         when it happens, you know? It's almost like I'm preparing myself for the failure, so it
         won't hurt as much. But at the same time, it's kind of depressing to always think like
         that. It's like I'm stuck in this negative cycle and I don't know how to get out of it.

Therapist: How does thinking you'll fail, or expecting to be disappointed, impact how you see
           yourself, like your worth or value as a person?


[9]

Patient: It makes me feel pretty worthless, honestly. Like, if I can't even do basic things without
         messing them up, what good am I? I see other people succeeding and it just reminds me that
         I'm not good enough. It's like there's something fundamentally wrong with me, and I don't
         know how to fix it. I try to tell myself that everyone makes mistakes, but it's hard to
         believe that when it feels like I'm the only one constantly failing.

Therapist: How does feeling like you're not good enough, or that there's something fundamentally
           wrong with you, influence your decisions about whether to take risks or pursue new goals,
           like the ones you mentioned earlier?


[10]

Patient: It makes me hesitant to try anything new. Like, what's the point if I know I'm just going
         to mess it up? It's easier to just stick with what I know, even if it's not great. I guess
         it's like I'm trying to protect myself from more failure, but at the same time, I know I'm
         just holding myself back. It's really frustrating. I want to move forward, but I'm also
         terrified of failing again. So I just end up feeling stuck.

Therapist: What values or principles would you need to see yourself making decisions by, in order to
           feel more confident in moving forward, even if it means taking some risks and potentially
           failing?


[11]

Patient: I think I'd need to focus more on the idea of progress, not perfection. Like, it's okay to
         try something and not be great at it right away. And maybe failure isn't always a bad
         thing, maybe it's just a part of learning and growing. I think if I could really believe
         that, I might feel more confident in taking risks. But it's hard to let go of that fear of
         not being good enough, you know? It's like it's ingrained in me or something.

Therapist: What do you think contributed to the development of this fear of not being good enough,
           and how has it been reinforced or perpetuated over time?


[12]

Patient: I think it started in childhood, honestly. My parents were really inconsistent, like one
         minute they'd be praising me, the next they'd be tearing me down. I never knew where I
         stood. And then in school, I always felt like I was behind everyone else. It's like I've
         always been playing catch-up, but never actually catching up. And now, as an adult, every
         time I fail at something, it's like that fear just gets stronger and stronger. It's this
         constant reminder that I'm not good enough, you know? It's hard to break out of that
         mindset.

Therapist: How does this fear of not being good enough affect your relationships with others, like
           friends, family, or romantic partners, and your ability to pursue activities or hobbies
           that bring you joy?


[13]

Patient: It makes it hard to open up to people, honestly. I always feel like I'm not interesting
         enough, or that they'll judge me if they know the real me. So I keep people at a distance.
         And as for hobbies, I barely even try anything new anymore. I mean, what's the point if I'm
         just going to suck at it, right? It's like this fear casts a shadow over everything. But I
         do really miss having fun, just for the sake of it. I just don't know how to get past this
         mental block.

Therapist: What are some things about yourself that you do value or appreciate, or things that
           you're proud of, that aren't necessarily related to your accomplishments or abilities,
           but are just a part of who you are as a person?


[14]

Patient: That's tough. I guess I value that I'm a pretty loyal friend. If someone needs help, I'll
         be there for them, no matter what. And I like that I'm creative, even if I don't do much
         with it these days. I used to love drawing and writing. I guess I'm also pretty empathetic,
         like I care about how other people are feeling. I just wish I could care about myself as
         much as I care about others, you know?

Therapist: What would it take for you to offer the same kindness, understanding, and acceptance to
           yourself that you offer to others, like your friends, when they're struggling or making
           mistakes?


[15]

Patient: I don't know, really. It's so much easier to be kind to others than it is to be kind to
         myself. I guess maybe it would help if I tried to talk to myself like I would a friend?
         Like, instead of beating myself up for every little mistake, maybe I could try to be more
         understanding. But it's hard. It feels like I have this automatic negative response every
         time I mess up. It's like I need to retrain my brain or something. I just don't know where
         to start.

Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week to start practicing self-compassion, even
           if it feels awkward or uncomfortable at first, and what might get in the way of you
           following through on that step?


[16]

Patient: Maybe I could try saying one nice thing to myself every day? Like, even if it's just
         something small, like "You made a really good cup of coffee today." I think the hardest
         part is going to be actually believing it, you know? Like, like even if I say the words,
         I'm not sure I'll really feel them. But I guess that's okay? Maybe it's a start at least. I
         don't know. I guess what might get in the way is just my own self-doubt. That little voice
         in my head that always tells me I'm not good enough. It's hard to ignore it.

Therapist: What if you were to view that self-doubting inner voice as a separate entity, rather than
           an integral part of yourself, and simply observe it without judgment? What would you say
           to yourself when you notice that voice?


[17]

Patient: Wow, that's a weird way to think about it. But I guess if it's not me, then maybe I could
         just acknowledge it and then...move on? Like, "Oh, hey self-doubt. I see you there. I'm not
         going to argue with you, but I'm also not going to let you control me." I don't know. It
         feels really strange to think about it that way, but also kind of...freeing? Like, if it's
         not me, then I don't have to engage with it.

Therapist: What if you were to imagine that you're standing on a shore, watching the self-doubt come
           and go with the waves, and you're the calm, steady ground that remains constant
           throughout? How would that feel, and what might you be able to accomplish with that sense
           of stability and presence?


[18]

Patient: That sounds...nice, actually. Like, maybe I wouldn't feel so tossed around by every little
         thought or feeling. Maybe I could actually focus on what I want, rather than just reacting
         to all the noise in my head. It feels peaceful, just thinking about it. Like, maybe I could
         finally take a breath and just...be. And maybe if I had that kind of stability, I could
         actually start working towards some of those goals I mentioned earlier. Maybe I could
         actually move forward.

Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week to start cultivating that sense of
           stability and presence, so that you can start moving forward towards your goals and
           values, rather than just reacting to your thoughts and feelings?


[19]

Patient: Maybe I could start with just a few minutes of quiet time each day? Like, maybe I could sit
         outside and just focus on the sounds around me, or even try some of those mindfulness
         exercises everyone talks about. I don't know. It feels a little silly, but I guess it
         couldn't hurt to try. I just don't want to feel like I'm failing at this too, you know?
         Like, what if I can't even do this right? But I guess that's just the self-doubt talking
         again. I guess I could just acknowledge it and try anyway.

Therapist: What if you were to approach these mindfulness exercises as an experiment, rather than a
           requirement for success, and simply focus on showing up and doing the best you can,
           rather than trying to do it "right"?


[20]

Patient: An experiment? Huh. Okay, yeah. maybe that would help. Like, I could just try it out and
         see what happens. And if it doesn't go perfectly, that's okay. I guess I could just focus
         on giving it a shot, rather than trying to be some sort of mindfulness master right away.
         Maybe I could even find some kind of guide or something, just to help me get started.

Therapist: What would you say to someone who's just starting out with mindfulness, if they came to
           you for advice?
