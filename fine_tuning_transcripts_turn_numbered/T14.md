# Transcript T14

[1]

Patient: Well, doc, I've been having a tough time lately. I lost my partner of 40 years and my job
         within months of each other. I've been using humor, or sarcasm as my kids call it, to get
         through the days, but it feels like it's not working anymore. I'm not sure therapy is going
         to help, but my daughter insisted I give it a shot.

Therapist: You've been through an incredibly tough time, losing your partner and job back-to-back.
           It's not surprising that humor has been a coping mechanism, but you mention it's not
           working anymore. What's been going on with your humor lately? How has it been helping you
           (or not) in terms of getting through the day?


[2]

Patient: Well, I've always been a bit of a jokester, you know? It's been helping me keep people at
         arm's length, avoid talking about how I'm really feeling. I crack a joke, everyone laughs,
         and we move on. No more questions. But lately, it feels forced. Like I'm just going through
         the motions. And when I'm alone, well, the jokes just don't seem so funny anymore. But I
         don't know what else to do. I'm not one for crying or talking about my feelings.

Therapist: You've been using humor to keep people at a distance and avoid really opening up. It's
           like you're using it as a way to avoid being vulnerable or having deeper conversations.
           What do you think would happen if you did start talking about your feelings, really
           talking, without the jokes? What's the worst that could come of it?


[3]

Patient: I don't know, never really thought about it. I guess I'm afraid that if I start talking
         about my feelings, I might just... break. I've been strong for so long, for everyone else.
         I don't want to burden them with my problems. And what if I can't stop crying once I start?
         I don't want to be that old man, sitting alone in his apartment, crying over his lost love.
         It's pathetic. Besides, talking about feelings, that's never done anyone any good.

Therapist: You're worried about being a burden to others and not wanting to appear weak. But what
           does being strong mean to you? Was it being strong for your partner during your 40 years
           together? How do you think your relationship would have been different if you'd been more
           open with your feelings, even when it was hard?


[4]

Patient: Strong means not complaining. It means getting the job done, no matter what. It means not
         bothering others with your problems. That's how I was with my partner. We had our roles,
         and mine was to be the strong one. I don't know if being more open would have changed
         anything. We were happy, weren't we? But I can't help but think... maybe if I'd been more
         open, they would have known something was wrong sooner. Maybe they would have gone to the
         doctor earlier. Maybe... maybe they'd still be here. But it's too late for that now.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a lot of what-ifs for you, especially about your relationship with
           your partner. Can you tell me more about what it is about not being more open that's
           haunting you? Is it the fear that they might have been able to do something different, or
           is it something else?


[5]

Patient: It's just... I can't help but think that if I'd been more open, more insistent about
         checking things out, I might not be where I am now though. I know I can't change the past,
         but I can't help but wonder. I get stuck on it. It's like a broken record, playing the same
         thing over and over again. But I don't see how talking about it now is going to change
         anything. What's done is done.

Therapist: You're saying that getting stuck on what-ifs is like a broken record for you, playing the
           same thoughts over and over. What does it do for you when you're stuck in this cycle?
           Does it help you feel like you're doing something about the situation, even if it's just
           thinking about it?


[6]

Patient: I wouldn't say it helps, but it's something. It's like I'm stuck in this hamster wheel,
         going round and round. It's not getting me anywhere, but it's familiar, you know? It's
         almost comforting in a weird way. Like at least I'm doing something, even if it's just
         driving myself crazy. But it's better than just sitting here, feeling nothing. At least it
         reminds me that I'm still alive. But I don't know, doc. I just don't know if I can keep
         doing this. It's exhausting.

Therapist: You mention that this cycle of rumination reminds you that you're still alive, but it
           sounds like it's also taking a toll on you. What if, instead of getting caught up in
           what-ifs, you were to focus on being present in this moment, with the pain and the grief,
           but also with the possibility of living the rest of your life?


[7]

Patient: Easier said than done, doc. I'm not sure I know how to do that. My life was my job and my
         partner. Now, I'm just an old man, living alone, with nothing but time on his hands and
         regrets in his head. Being present just reminds me of all the things I've lost, of all the
         things I should have done differently. It's not as simple as just moving on, you know.

Therapist: I'm not asking you to move on or forget what you've lost. Being present doesn't mean
           erasing the past or the pain. It means living with it, in this moment, with all its
           complexities and difficulties. Can you imagine being present with your regrets, with your
           grief, without trying to change the past or fix it, but simply being with it?


[8]

Patient: I don't know, doc. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to just sit with this...
         this heaviness in my chest. It's like a black hole, threatening to swallow me whole. I
         don't know how to be with that. I don't know how to be with anything anymore. I just want
         it to go away. But it won't, will it?

Therapist: You're feeling like this heaviness is a black hole that's hard to be near. It's like
           you're trying to push it away or get rid of it. Can you imagine allowing yourself to be
           with this heaviness, not fighting it or trying to change it, but simply being with it, as
           it is, in this moment?


[9]

Patient: I said I don't know how to do that, doc. I don't know how to just be with this... this
         darkness. I don't know how to stop fighting it. I don't know how to do any of this. I just
         want to go back to how things were. But I can't, can I?

Therapist: You're right, you can't go back to how things were. But sometimes, when we're faced with
           the impossibility of going back, we can find a way to move forward. Can you imagine that
           this darkness, this grief, is a part of your life now, but it's not all of your life?


[10]

Patient: I don't know, doc. I don't know how to move forward. I don't know what's left for me. I
         just know that I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm tired of feeling like I'm
         stuck in this... this darkness. I just want to feel like I'm living again. But I don't know
         how.

Therapist: You're not looking for a way to erase the pain, but to find a way to live with it. Can
           you imagine taking small steps, doing something that brings you a little bit of joy or
           interest, even if it's just for a few minutes a day?


[11]

Patient: I don't know, doc. I can't even remember what it's like to feel joy anymore. I can't
         remember the last time I did something just because I wanted to. It all feels so pointless
         now. But I guess I could try. I just don't know where to start.

Therapist: You're not looking for a big, grand thing to start with. Just a small step. What's
           something you used to enjoy doing, something that might bring a tiny bit of joy, that you
           could try doing again?


[12]

Patient: I used to love cooking, obviously. But now, it's just a chore. It's just something I have
         to do to get by. I don't know how to find joy in it anymore. But I guess I could try making
         something new. Something I've never made before. Just to see if I still can.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Trying something new can be scary, but it's also a way to see if you
           can still find joy in it. What's one new recipe or dish you've always wanted to try
           making, but never have?


[13]

Patient: I've always wanted to try making those fancy French pastries. You know, the ones with all
         the layers and the butter. I never had the time before, or the patience. But I guess I have
         plenty of both now. I just don't know if I have the heart. But I guess I could try.

Therapist: Making those French pastries can be a big project, but it's also a way to challenge
           yourself and do something creative. What if you saw this as an opportunity to rediscover
           your creative side, not just to make something delicious, but to express yourself in a
           new way?


[14]

Patient: I don't know about all that, doc. I'm just trying to make some pastries, not have some big
         emotional breakthrough. I just want to see if I can still do it, you know? I just want to
         feel like I'm good at something again. But I guess we'll see. I'm not making any promises.

Therapist: That's a perfectly reasonable approach. You're not committing to anything big, just
           taking a small step to see if you can still do something you enjoyed. Can you commit to
           buying a cookbook or looking up a recipe for those French pastries this week, just to
           take that first small step?


[15]

Patient: I guess I can do that, doc. I can't promise I'll actually make them, but I can at least
         look up a recipe. But I'm not sure how this is supposed to help anything. But I guess it
         can't hurt.

Therapist: You're right, it's not a magic solution, but sometimes taking small steps can help us
           build momentum and confidence. Let's not worry too much about how this will "help"
           anything right now. Just focus on taking that first step and seeing what happens. What's
           the first thing you'll do when you look up that recipe?


[16]

Patient: I guess I'll just do a search online. See what comes up. Maybe look for a recipe that
         doesn't look too crazy. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew, you know? I just
         want to see if I can still do it. But I guess I won't know until I try.

Therapist: That's a great attitude. You're not trying to prove anything to anyone, including
           yourself. You're just experimenting with something new, to see what's possible. Can you
           see this as an opportunity to learn and discover, rather than to prove a point?


[17]

Patient: I don't know about all that, doc. I'm just going to look up a recipe and see what happens.
         I'm not trying to have some big life-changing moment or anything. I just want to see if I
         can still cook like I used to. That's all. I don't see what the big deal is.

Therapist: I think you're selling yourself short, but I'm glad you're approaching this with a
           straightforward attitude. You're right, it's not about having a big life-changing moment,
           it's just about taking a small step towards doing something you used to enjoy. I think
           that's a great place to start.


[18]

Patient: I guess. I just don't want to get my hopes up, you know? I just want to take things one
         step at a time. I don't want to expect too much from myself. I just want to see what
         happens. But I guess that's enough for now. I just don't want to promise anything.

Therapist: I completely understand. You're being very wise to take things slowly and not put too
           much pressure on yourself. That's a great way to approach this, and it's exactly what
           we're doing here - taking small steps and seeing what happens. I think that's a great way
           to end our session for today.


[19]

Patient: Alright, doc. I guess I'll try looking up that recipe before our next session. But like I
         said, no promises. I just want to take things one step at a time. I just don't want to get
         ahead of myself. But I'll see what I can do.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next
           session. Remember, no pressure, just take things one step at a time. And if you need to
           adjust your plans or talk about anything that comes up, you know I'm here to listen.


[20]

Patient: Yeah, yeah, I know, doc. I'll do my best. But I'm not making any promises. I just want to
         take things one step at a time. I'll see you next session.

Therapist: Sounds good. I'll see you next session. Have a good day.
