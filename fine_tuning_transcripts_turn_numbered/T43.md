# Transcript T43

[1]

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really stuck in these loops of beating myself
         up. I had a health scare recently, and it's got me thinking I should be handling things
         better, you know? But I've always been the kind to figure things out on my own, so asking
         for help doesn't come easy.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, especially with the health scare on top of it. When you think
           you should be handling things better, what does that mean to you - what are some specific
           things you feel you're not doing well enough?


[2]

Patient: I dunno, just basic stuff. like I've been so tired lately, I've let some things slide,
         dishes pile up, laundry doesn't get done as promptly... And lesson plans, ugh, I used to be
         so on top of them, now it feels like I'm scrambling last minute. I should have it together,
         I'm not some newbie anymore. Plus, I've been snappy with folks at school, colleagues, even
         some students. That's not me, or at least it didn't used to be. I just don't know...

Therapist: It sounds like a lot is riding on you feeling like you have things under control,
           especially since you've built a reputation at school. When you say "I should have it
           together," what does it mean to you to have it together - is it about being perfect,
           being admired by others, or something else?


[3]

Patient: Ha, I don't know about perfect, but competent, you know? Like, I'm the one people come to
         for help, not the other way around. I guess having it together means not having to ask
         others for support, it means everything's running smoothly, like a well-oiled machine. It
         means not letting things get to me, just handling it all and then some. I don't know if
         that makes sense, but it's like if I can't do that, then who am I? I've always been the one
         who can handle it all.

Therapist: It makes sense that having it together means being the person who can handle everything,
           but what happens when you're not able to do that? What does it feel like inside when
           you're struggling and can't keep up, like when the dishes pile up or you snap at others?


[4]

Patient: I don't know, it's like this heavy feeling, I guess. It's like when I'm not on top of
         everything I'm just like a burden or like I'm failing myself... failing others. Seriously,
         I get a knot in my chest just thinking about it. You know, it's like a voice in my head
         telling me I'm not good enough it's like I'm letting everyone down, like I'm not... I don't
         know, enough, I guess. I just don't know how to not feel that way, you know? It's not like
         I can just flip a switch.

Therapist: It sounds like this voice is really harsh and critical - what do you think it's trying to
           keep you from, or protect you from, by telling you that you're not good enough?


[5]

Patient: It's like it's trying to keep me from being lazy, I guess? Or from just totally falling
         apart. Like, maybe if I listen to it and just try harder, then I won't feel so... I don't
         know, useless, I guess. It's like it's trying to make sure I don't give up, but at the same
         time, it's like it's always finding faults too. I don't know, it's weird. It's like I can't
         win either way.

Therapist: It sounds like this voice is trying to motivate you to work harder, but it's doing it in
           a way that's also really critical and harsh. What if, instead of trying to be perfect and
           never make mistakes, you focused on what's truly important to you - what are some things
           that you value and want to stand for in your life and your teaching?


[6]

Patient: Yeah, but it's not that simple. I mean, I get what you're saying, but just focusing on what
         I want isn't gonna make the dishes clean themselves or get my lesson plans done any faster.
         I dunno, I value my work, my students, I guess I want to stand for being reliable and, you
         know, competent. But that all goes out the window if I can't keep up. I just don't see how
         I can just let go and not beat myself up, not without watching everything fall apart.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that if you let go of beating yourself up, everything will
           fall apart. What if, instead of letting go of being responsible and competent, you were
           to let go of the idea that you have to be perfect and in control all the time? Could you
           be responsible and competent in a way that allows for mistakes and imperfections?


[7]

Patient: Yeah, but, I don't know, that just feels like an excuse to slack off, you know? Like, sure,
         I can say "Oh, I'm just letting go of being perfect" but then isn't that just an excuse for
         when things go wrong? It's like saying it's okay to make mistakes is just setting myself up
         for actually making mistakes, knowing I could've done better. I don't know, it just feels
         like I'm tricking myself into lowering my standards or something.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of making mistakes is really tied to your sense of identity and
           self-worth - what would it take for you to feel like you're still a responsible and
           competent person even if you make mistakes or don't meet your high standards?


[8]

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'd have to know for sure that people still respected me, you know?
         Like, if I knew others still thought I was competent, even if I wasn't always perfect,
         maybe that would help. But that's the thing, isn't it? I can't control what others think. I
         mean, I guess I'd have to feel like I still respected myself, but that's kinda hard when
         you know you've let things slip. It's all just so... complicated.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for self-respect from yourself that's based on your own
           values and worth, rather than what others think. Can you think of a time when you felt
           truly respected yourself, even when things weren't going perfectly - what was that like,
           and what contributed to that feeling?


[9]

Patient: I guess maybe there was this one time, when I first started teaching, I had this really
         tough class. I mean, they were just a handful. I was trying all these different strategies,
         some worked, some totally bombed, but I just kept at it. I remember feeling like, even when
         things weren't going great, I was still trying my best, still learning, you know? I guess I
         respected myself for not giving up, for being willing to try and fail and learn. It was
         tough, but it was like, I knew I was doing my best, and that was enough, even if the
         results weren't always perfect. But that just feels so hard to hold onto now, you know?
         It's like, I expect more of myself now.

Therapist: It sounds like that experience was really powerful for you - can you try to tap into that
           feeling of self-respect again, right now, in this moment, and see if you can remember
           what it was about your actions that made you feel respected?


[10]

Patient: I don't know, I mean, I guess I just felt like I was really trying, you know? Like, I
         wasn't just going through the motions, I was really putting effort in. I guess I respected
         myself for that, for not just throwing in the towel when it got tough. But it's hard to
         feel that way now, it's like, I expect so much more from myself these days. I don't know,
         maybe I'm just too hard on myself? But it's like, how do I ease up without just feeling
         lazy, you know? It's a fine line.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about being too hard on yourself, but also worried about
           being too easy on yourself. What if, instead of trying to be perfect, you were to be kind
           to yourself when you're not meeting your high standards - what would that look like, and
           how would you know you're being kind rather than lazy?


[11]

Patient: I don't know, I guess being kind would be like, acknowledging that I'm doing my best, even
         if it's not perfect? But how do you know, you know? Like, how do you know you're not just
         making excuses for yourself? I guess if I'm kind to myself, I'd still be trying, still be
         putting effort in, just not beating myself up so much. But it's so hard to find that
         balance, you know? It's like, I don't want to just give myself a free pass, but I also
         don't want to be so hard on myself that I'm just constantly stressed and unhappy.

Therapist: What if, when you're beating yourself up over not meeting your high standards, you were
           to approach that self-criticism with curiosity - not judgment - and ask yourself, "What's
           driving this self-criticism? What's really going on here?" What do you think you might
           learn about yourself and your expectations if you approached it that way?


[12]

Patient: I don't know, I mean, I guess I'd wonder if it's just fear, you know? Like, fear of not
         being good enough, fear of letting people down. Maybe I'd learn that it's just a lot of
         pressure I put on myself, like, that it's not really coming from anywhere else, it's just
         all in my head. But then what? I mean, yeah, okay, so maybe it is just fear, but how does
         that help me, you know? It's not like knowing that suddenly makes it all go away.

Therapist: You're right, knowing that it's fear doesn't necessarily make it go away, but it can
           change how you relate to it - can you think of a time when you faced your fear and took
           action despite it, rather than letting it hold you back? What would it take for you to
           take a similar step now, and what small action could you take today to move towards a
           more compassionate and balanced approach?


[13]

Patient: Yeah, I guess there have been times, like when I first started teaching, I was terrified,
         but I just did it, you know? I didn't let the fear stop me. But this feels different, it's
         not just fear of something outside of me, it's like, I'm scared of myself, of not being
         enough. I don't know what it would take, maybe just... maybe just trying to notice it more,
         when it's happening, when I'm beating myself up. Maybe just trying to pause and ask myself,
         you know, what's really going on here? But it's so hard, it's like, I don't want to be too
         easy on myself, but I also don't want to be so hard on myself that I'm just constantly
         miserable.

As for a small action, I don't know, maybe I could try to just pick one thing, one thing I always
beat myself up about, and just try to be a bit kinder to myself about it. Like, maybe the dishes,
maybe I could just try to remember that it's okay if they pile up sometimes, it's not the end of the
world. But it's so much easier said than done, you know?

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try to be kinder to yourself about the dishes, but
           you're worried it's not going to be enough. What if, instead of trying to be perfect with
           the dishes, you were to commit to simply noticing when you're beating yourself up about
           them, and then choosing to do something kind for yourself in that moment - like taking a
           few deep breaths or reminding yourself that it's okay to have a messy house sometimes?


[14]

Patient: Yeah, okay, I guess I could try that. I mean, it's not like it's gonna hurt anything,
         right? So, okay, I'll try to just notice it, when I'm being hard on myself about the
         dishes, and then, I don't know, maybe I'll try to take a few breaths, remind myself that
         it's not a big deal. I can't promise it'll work, but yeah, okay, I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a small step towards being kinder to yourself, and that's a
           great start. What if, for the next week, you commit to noticing when you're beating
           yourself up about the dishes, and taking a few deep breaths or reminding yourself that
           it's okay to have a messy house? Not because you're trying to achieve some kind of
           perfection, but because you're choosing to be kind to yourself in that moment - can you
           commit to that for the next week?


[15]

Patient: Yeah, alright, I can do that. I mean, it's just a week, right? I can try it for a week. No
         promises after that, but yeah, I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to give it a try for a week - what if, at the end of that
           week, we check in and see how it's gone, and you can decide from there whether you want
           to continue or try something new?


[16]

Patient: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Let's see how it goes and then I can decide. No point in
         getting ahead of myself, right? So, yeah, I'll try it for a week and then we'll see.
         Thanks, I guess. Talk to you later.

Therapist: Sounds good, I'm glad we could work together to come up with a plan. Remember, it's not
           about being perfect, it's about taking small steps towards being kinder to yourself. I'll
           see you next time, and we can check in on how things are going. Take care of yourself
           until then.


[17]

Patient: Yeah, yeah, I got it. I'll see how it goes. Catch you later, bye.

Therapist: It seems like the session has come to a close. The patient has made a commitment to try
           self-compassion for a specific timeframe, and has a clear direction for action. They have
           also demonstrated a willingness to reassess and make changes based on their experience.


[18]

Patient: Yeah, okay, talk to you later.

Therapist: It was a pleasure working with you. I'll see you next time. Have a good day.


[19]

Patient: Bye.

Therapist: Goodbye.


[20]

Patient: Bye

Therapist: Goodbye.
