# Transcript T31

[1]

Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I started a new job at a big accounting firm,
         and the workload is immense. I've been snapping at my coworkers and even at my family,
         which is not like me at all. I just feel so frustrated and angry all the time, and I'm not
         sure how to handle it.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, especially with the adjustment to a new job. When you snap at
           your coworkers and family, what do you think is happening in that moment that makes you
           lose control?


[2]

Patient: I don't know exactly. It's like everything just builds up inside me, and then suddenly I
         can't take it anymore. It's not like I want to snap at people, but it's like all the stress
         and frustration just boils over.

Therapist: That boiling over sensation sounds incredibly overwhelming. Can you think of a specific
           thought or situation that tends to trigger this feeling of everything building up inside
           you, like a straw that might be adding to the pressure?


[3]

Patient: Well, I think it's usually when someone asks me to do something that I percieve as trivial
         or unnecessary. They might not realize how much is on my plate so I get frustrated that
         they believe I have the capacity to take on more. For example, the other day, a coworker
         asked me to show them how to use the expense reporting software again, even though I'd
         already shown them twice. I just lost it, and I snapped at them. I felt terrible afterward,
         but I just couldn't help it.

Therapist: It sounds like you feel a bit taken advantage of and frustrated when your coworkers don't
           seem to understand your workload. What happens right after you snap at them - do you feel
           a strong sense of guilt or regret, and if so, what's the first thing that comes to mind
           when you think about that feeling?


[4]

Patient: Yes, I do feel guilty right afterward. The first thing that comes to mind is that I've
         failed in some way. I should be able to handle everything without getting so frustrated. I
         don't want to be the kind of person who snaps at others, and I feel terrible when I do.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of self-doubt that comes up when you snap at someone,
           feeling like you've failed in some way. What does being "able to handle everything" mean
           to you, and how does that relate to who you want to be as a person or as an employee?


[5]

Patient: I think being able to handle everything means being capable, reliable, and unflappable,
         which is what I've always prided myself on. I want to be the person others can depend on,
         and I want to feel in control of my emotions and my workload. When I snap at someone, it
         feels like I'm none of those things.

Therapist: It sounds like being capable, reliable, and in control are really important to you, and
           snapping at someone feels like a betrayal of those values. Given the immense workload
           you're facing at the new job, how do you think these values are influencing how you're
           approaching your work, and are there any specific actions you're taking (or not taking)
           to uphold them in the face of this challenge?


[6]

Patient: I think these values are making it hard for me to delegate or ask for help. I feel like I
         should be able to handle it all, so I just keep piling more on my plate. I've been working
         late every night, and even on the weekends, just to keep up. I haven't asked for any
         extensions or talked to my boss about how overwhelmed I feel. I guess I'm afraid that if I
         do, they'll think I'm not as capable as they hoped.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of "should" around handling everything yourself, and
           that's causing you to work excessively long hours and avoid asking for help. Can you
           think of a scenario where you might be able to uphold your value of capability without
           having to do everything yourself, perhaps by finding a more efficient way of working or
           by delegating tasks effectively?


[7]

Patient: I'm not sure. I mean, I could probably ask my assistant to help with some of the smaller
         tasks, but I worry that if I do, things won't be done right. I like to have control over
         every aspect, and it's hard to trust that someone else can do it as well. Plus, I don't
         want to burden others with my work. I know that's not always realistic, but it's how I
         feel.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about burdening others with your work, and that's making it
           hard for you to delegate tasks. What is it about burdening others that feels so
           significant to you? Is it a sense of responsibility to not add to their workload, or is
           there something else at play?


[8]

Patient: It's just that I know everyone is busy, and I don't want to add to their stress. I guess
         there's also a part of me that feels like if I can't handle it, then I shouldn't be in this
         position. I should be able to manage my workload, and if I can't, then maybe I'm not as
         capable as I thought. It's like I have something to prove to myself and to others.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of identity tied to being capable and competent, and
           that's making it hard for you to ask for help or admit to feeling overwhelmed. What would
           happen if you were to accept that it's okay to not have all the answers or to ask for
           help - would that mean you're not a capable person, or would it be okay to be vulnerable
           in that way?


[9]

Patient: I guess I'm afraid that if I ask for help, people will think less of me. Like I'm not as
         competent as they thought. But when I think about it, I know that's not fair to myself.
         Everyone needs help sometimes, and it doesn't make them any less capable. It's just hard to
         apply that same logic to myself.

Therapist: It sounds like you intellectually understand that asking for help doesn't diminish your
           competence, but there's still a strong emotional response that's making it hard to act on
           that understanding. What does it feel like when you imagine others thinking less of you -
           is it a sense of shame, disappointment, or something else?


[10]

Patient: It feels like anxiety, mostly. Like a knot in my stomach. I start to worry about what
         they'll think of me, if they'll regret hiring me, if I'll lose their respect. It's like a
         wave of uncertainty and fear washes over me. I just hate the idea of letting people down.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of letting people down is a big motivator for you, and it's
           causing a lot of anxiety. What is it about letting people down that's so significant to
           you - is it a sense of responsibility to meet others' expectations, or is there something
           deeper at play?


[11]

Patient: I think it goes back to my upbringing. I was always taught to put others first, to be
         reliable, and to never let people down. I guess I've just always felt like it's my
         responsibility to meet others' expectations, no matter what. It's like I have to earn my
         worth through what I do for others.

Therapist: It sounds like you've taken on a significant responsibility to meet others' expectations,
           and that's affecting your sense of worth. What would happen if you were to let someone
           down, not because you're trying to, but because you're human and it's okay to make
           mistakes - would that mean you're not worthy or lovable as a person?


[12]

Patient: I know logically that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn't define their worth, but
         it's hard to feel that way. I guess I'm just scared that if I let someone down, they'll see
         me differently. Maybe they'd be disappointed, or maybe they'd think I'm not as good as they
         thought I was. It's hard to not take that personally, you know?

Therapist: It sounds like you're deeply invested in how others see you, and that's causing a lot of
           anxiety about letting people down. Can you think of a time when someone you let down or
           made a mistake, but you still maintained a close and loving relationship with them - what
           was it about that relationship that helped you stay connected despite the mistake?


[13]

Patient: I suppose there's my wife. I've snapped at her before, and I've made mistakes, but she's
         always been there for me. She understands that I'm not perfect, and she loves me anyway. I
         think it's because she sees me for who I am, not just what I do. She knows my heart is in
         the right place, even if I mess up sometimes. That's why it's so hard when I snap at her,
         because I know she deserves better.

Therapist: It sounds like your wife's love and acceptance have helped you see that you're more than
           just your actions, and that's a really beautiful thing. Can you imagine extending that
           same kindness and acceptance to yourself when you make mistakes, rather than beating
           yourself up over it?


[14]

Patient: That's easier said than done. I've always been my own worst critic. I guess I just hold
         myself to a really high standard, and it's hard to let go of that. But I do see how it
         would be helpful to be kinder to myself. I just don't know where to start.

Therapist: It sounds like being kinder to yourself might be a new and unfamiliar way of being for
           you, but it's something you're open to exploring. What if, instead of being your own
           worst critic, you started to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that
           you offer to others, like your wife?


[15]

Patient: I think that would feel really strange at first. I'm so used to being hard on myself. But I
         guess it would also be a relief, in a way. I just don't know how to make that switch. It's
         like I need a manual or something.

Therapist: It doesn't have to be a complete overhaul, and it's not about getting it right or wrong.
           A small step could be starting each day by acknowledging one thing you did well, no
           matter how small it seems. It's a way of practicing kindness towards yourself, one small
           act at a time.


[16]

Patient: That seems manageable. I already journal every morning, so I guess I could add that in. It
         feels a bit silly, but I guess it can't hurt to try. I just need to be careful not to turn
         it into another way to criticize myself.

Therapist: That's a great point to be mindful of. What if, instead of focusing on "getting it
           right," you frame the exercise as simply noticing and acknowledging your strengths,
           without judgment? For example, you could say to yourself, "I did a good job getting out
           of bed today," or "I'm proud of myself for showing up to this conversation."


[17]

Patient: Alright, I can try that. It might take some practice, but I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to give it a try. What if you were to apply this same
           kindness and understanding to other areas of your life, like when you're feeling
           overwhelmed at work or snapping at your coworkers? How might that change your experience
           of those situations?


[18]

Patient: I'm not sure. I guess maybe if I was kinder to myself, I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed all
         the time. Maybe I wouldn't be so quick to snap at people either. But it's hard to imagine
         actually doing that in the moment.

Therapist: It can be hard to imagine being kind to ourselves in the heat of the moment. But what if,
           instead of trying to be kind, you simply focused on being present with your emotions and
           thoughts, without judgment? Can you imagine paying attention to your breath, your body,
           and your surroundings, and allowing yourself to be exactly as you are in that moment?


[19]

Patient: I think I can imagine that. It sounds a bit like meditation or something. I've never been
         very good at that kind of thing, but I suppose it couldn't hurt to try. I just worry that
         I'll judge myself anyway. It's like I can't help it.

Therapist: It's common to worry about judging ourselves, but what if you were to meet your
           self-judgment with kindness, rather than trying to stop it? For example, if you catch
           yourself thinking, "I'm not good at this," you could say to yourself, "Ah, it seems like
           I'm judging myself again. That's okay. I'm doing the best I can."


[20]

Patient: That makes sense. I guess I could try that. It's like giving myself permission to not be
         perfect. I like the idea of meeting it with kindness, rather than trying to stop it.

Therapist: Giving yourself permission to not be perfect can be incredibly liberating. What if this
           sense of kindness and self-acceptance started to bleed into other areas of your life,
           like your relationships or your work? How might that change your experience of those
           situations?
