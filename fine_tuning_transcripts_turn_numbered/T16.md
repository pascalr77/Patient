# Transcript T16

[1]

Patient: I've been feeling on edge lately, doc. It's this job, it's getting to me. I keep worrying I
         can't keep up with the younger guys, and it's making me put things off. I don't know, maybe
         it's all in my head, but it's a real pain.

Therapist: That worry about not keeping up with the younger guys is really weighing on you, isn't
           it? What's one specific thing that's making you think you're not measuring up?


[2]

Patient: I don't know, it's just this feeling I get. They're always so quick, always having energy.
         I remember a few weeks ago, I was laying some bricks, and I could see them looking at me
         like I was going slow. Maybe I was, I don't know. It just stuck with me. But who knows,
         maybe they weren't even thinking that. It's not like I can read minds, right? Maybe I am
         being silly.

Therapist: That incident with the coworkers looking at you while you were laying bricks has been
           stuck with you. What do you think would happen if you approached them now and asked how
           you were doing?


[3]

Patient: I don't see the point in that. I already know what they'll say. They'll just tell me I'm
         doing fine, even if I'm not. That's what people do, isn't it? They say things to make you
         feel better, not because they're true. Anyway, I don't want to look weak by asking. I
         should just know, shouldn't I? I should just be able to do my job without needing
         reassurance.

Therapist: You're worried about looking weak by asking for feedback, and that you should already
           know if you're doing okay. What do you think would happen if you started to ask for help
           or feedback more often, not just from coworkers, but from anyone in your life, including
           friends or family?


[4]

Patient: I don't know, doc. I'm not really one to ask for help. I've always figured if I can't do
         something on my own, then I shouldn't be doing it at all. My dad always told me, "If you
         want something done right, you do it yourself." Asking for help, that's just admitting I
         can't do it right. And I don't want to be a burden on anyone, especially not my family.
         They've got their own lives to live.

Therapist: That's a pretty clear message from your dad - self-sufficiency is the goal. But what if
           needing help doesn't mean you're not capable, but rather that you're acknowledging you're
           part of a team or a community that can support each other?


[5]

Patient: I guess I see what you're getting at, doc, but it's not that simple. I've always been on my
         own, done things my way. I don't want to be a bother, have people thinking I'm some sort of
         charity case. And what if they say no? Then I'm back where I started, but now I've shown
         weakness. It's a lose-lose, doc.

Therapist: What would you say is more important to you in your relationships with others - being
           seen as strong and self-sufficient, or being able to be open and honest about your needs,
           even if it's scary or uncomfortable?


[6]

Patient: Well, doc, I guess being seen as strong has always been important to me. I don't want
         people thinking I can't handle things on my own. But I get what you're saying, about being
         open and honest. I just don't know if I'm ready for that yet. It's a lot to think about,
         that's for sure.

Therapist: Being seen as strong has been a way to protect yourself from feeling vulnerable, hasn't
           it? What do you think you'd be risking by being open and honest about your needs, even if
           it means not being seen as strong all the time?


[7]

Patient: I guess I'd be risking rejection, doc. If I open up and people don't like what they see,
         then what? I'm just setting myself up for disappointment. It's easier to just keep things
         to myself, not bother anyone with my problems. I've gotten this far on my own, haven't I?

Therapist: You've gotten this far on your own, but what does that mean for your relationships and
           your overall well-being? What are the costs of keeping everything to yourself, not just
           the potential benefits of opening up?


[8]

Patient: I suppose keeping it all in does that get to you. I've been feeling pretty lonely, doc. I
         mean, I've got my routine, I've got my work, but it's not like I've got anyone to really
         talk to. I guess that's the cost, isn't it? But it's still a risk, opening up. I don't know
         if I can just flip a switch and change how I've always been.

Therapist: Feeling lonely can be really painful, and it sounds like it's been a trade-off you've
           made for being seen as strong. What's one thing you've always wanted in a relationship
           that you feel like you've been missing out on because of this?


[9]

Patient: I guess I've always wanted someone to just listen, you know? Really understand where I'm
         coming from. I want someone to see me, not just the strong exterior, but the rest too. I
         just don't know if that's something people want to see, doc. It's easier to just put on a
         brave face.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to show the real you, especially when you're used to hiding
           behind a brave face. What would it mean to you to find someone who accepts and
           understands you, not just on the surface, but in all your complexities?


[10]

Patient: It would mean a lot, doc. It would mean I don't have to pretend anymore. But that's a big
         ask. I don't know if anyone would want to take that on. I guess I'm just not sure it's
         worth the risk, you know?

Therapist: What would you say is more important to you - being seen as strong and in control, or
           being seen and understood for who you truly are, even if that means being vulnerable?


[11]

Patient: I guess being understood, doc. But it's not that simple. I can't just turn off the part of
         me that needs to be in control, that wants to be seen as strong. It's who I am, or who I've
         become, anyway. I don't know if I can change that, even if I want to.

Therapist: What do you think would happen if you were able to let go of needing to be seen as
           strong, just for a little while? What might you gain, or what might you be able to
           explore, by taking a step back from that need?


[12]

Patient: I don't know, doc. I guess I might feel a bit lighter, not so tense all the time. Maybe I'd
         be able to connect with people more, not just keep them at arm's length. But it's not like
         I can just turn that off, you know? It's been a part of me for so long, it's not something
         I can just shrug off. I don't know if I'm ready to let go of that, doc. It's been keeping
         me safe, hasn't it?

Therapist: You mentioned feeling safe with this need for control. What do you think you'd be
           exposing yourself to if you were to let go of it?


[13]

Patient: I guess I'd be opening myself up to getting hurt, doc. If I'm not in control, who knows
         what could happen. People could take advantage, or they might see the real me and not like
         it. It's scary, doc. I don't know if I can just let go of that safety net.

Therapist: You're worried about being taken advantage of or rejected if you let your guard down. But
           what if that safety net isn't actually protecting you from those things, but rather from
           being fully alive and connected with others?


[14]

Patient: That's a big what-if, doc. I don't know if I can just flip a switch and change how I've
         always been. I get what you're saying, but it's not that easy. I've been this way for so
         long, it's not something I can just shake off.

Therapist: You don't have to try to flip a switch and change everything at once. What's one small
           step you could take this week to start moving in the direction of being more open and
           vulnerable, even if it feels scary?


[15]

Patient: I don't know, doc. Maybe I could try talking to my neighbor, he's been trying to chat with
         me for a while. I guess I could start there. No promises, though. It's not as easy as you
         make it sound. I'll think about it, doc. That's all I can do for now.

Therapist: That's a great start - taking small steps can be really powerful. When you talk to your
           neighbor, see what happens if you just show up and listen to them, without trying to
           control the conversation or hide behind your usual self. Just be present and see what you
           can learn.


[16]

Patient: Alright, doc. I'll give it a shot. But I'm not making any promises. I don't know if I can
         just be present like you say. I'll try, but it's not going to be easy.

Therapist: That's all anyone can ask for - a willingness to try. Remember, you're not trying to
           become a completely different person, but rather taking small steps towards being more
           open and honest with others. That's okay, and it's okay if it's hard.


[17]

Patient: Okay, doc. I hear you. It's just hard to imagine not being in control all the time. I'll
         try, though. That's all I can do, right? Just try.

Therapist: That's exactly right - just trying is a huge step. We've made some good progress here
           today, and it's okay to take things one small step at a time. Remember, it's not about
           being in control all the time, but about being willing to take risks and be open to new
           experiences. I'm here to support you as you continue this journey.


[18]

Patient: I guess that's good to know, doc. I just don't want to feel like I'm failing if I can't do
         this right away. I'll try, though. I will.

Therapist: You won't be failing if you try and it doesn't work out exactly as you hope. That's not
           what this is about. It's about taking small steps towards being more open and honest, and
           seeing what happens. Every step you take, no matter how small, is a success in itself.


[19]

Patient: I guess that makes sense, doc. I just don't want to feel like I'm letting myself down, you
         know? But I hear you, small steps. I can try that.

Therapist: You're not letting yourself down by taking small steps. In fact, you're taking care of
           yourself by acknowledging that you're not ready to change everything at once. You're
           being kind to yourself by being realistic about your capacity for change.


[20]

Patient: I guess I never thought of it that way, doc. I'm just not sure I know how to be kind to
         myself, you know? It's not something I'm used to. But I hear you, doc. I hear you.

Therapist: That's okay, being kind to yourself is a skill that can be learned. It might feel a bit
           awkward at first, but it's worth it. Would you be willing to practice being kind to
           yourself this week, maybe in small ways, like taking a break when you need it or
           acknowledging your efforts?
