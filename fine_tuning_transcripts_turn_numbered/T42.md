[1]

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've just been feeling so overwhelmed. Ever since things
         went south with my family, I've been stuck in this fog of sadness. It's like I can't find
         the energy or motivation to do anything, and it's starting to affect my relationship.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, and it's clear this is affecting your relationship. Can you
           tell me more about what happened with your family and how that's been impacting your
           daily life lately?


[2]

Patient: It's been a mess. My parents had a nasty divorce a few months back, and it's like I had to
         choose sides. Now, it's just constant tension and arguing. I wake up with this heavy
         feeling, and it's hard to get through the day. I snap at my partner too, which isn't fair
         to them. It's like I'm stuck in this dark cloud, and it's affecting everything.

Therapist: That must be really tough to navigate, especially when it feels like you're caught in the
           middle. What happens right before you snap at your partner - is there a thought or
           feeling that shows up that you can recognize, and what does it do for you in that moment?


[3]

Patient: I don't know, it's like this wave of irritation just washes over me. Like, why can't they
         just understand what I'm going through? It's like I want them to see my pain, to
         acknowledge it. But then, I just end up feeling guilty for taking it out on them. It's not
         their fault, but it's like I can't control it.

Therapist: That wave of irritation can be overwhelming. What do you think would happen if your
           partner did understand your pain and acknowledged it - what would that mean to you, and
           what would it allow you to do differently in the relationship?


[4]

Patient: I guess if they really understood, I wouldn't feel so alone in all this. Maybe I could
         start to lean on them more, instead of just feeling like I'm pushing them away all the
         time. I don't know, it's just hard to think about. It's like I want to protect them from
         all this mess, but also need them to be there for me. It's all so confusing.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in. What would it mean to you to feel like
           you're not burdening your partner, but rather, you're able to be open with them about
           your struggles and needs - what would that look like in your relationship?


[5]

Patient: I don't know, that's scary to even think about. I guess if I could be open with them, I'd
         feel more... connected? Like they're really seeing me, not just the happy stuff, but the
         messy stuff too. Maybe I wouldn't feel so alone, like I have to handle all this by myself.
         But it's hard to even imagine that. What if they can't handle it? What if it's too much for
         them?

Therapist: What if your partner's ability to handle your emotions isn't about them being able to
           handle it, but about you trusting them to be there for you, even when things get messy?
           What would that look like for you, to trust them in that way?


[6]

Patient: That's a hard one. I guess if I trusted them like that, I'd be more open about what I'm
         going through. I wouldn't just say "I'm fine" all the time. Maybe I'd actually talk about
         how much I'm hurting, how confused I am. But that's so hard to do. I don't want to be a
         burden, you know? It's like I want them to be there for me, but I'm also terrified of
         needing them too much.

Therapist: What if needing someone doesn't have to mean being a burden, but rather, it means you're
           willing to be vulnerable and open with them? Can you think of a time when you needed
           someone and it wasn't a burden for them, but rather, it deepened the relationship?


[7]

Patient: Maybe with my best friend from college. When my grandma died, I was a wreck. I really
         needed her, and she was just... there. She didn't try to fix anything, she just listened
         and sat with me. It didn't feel like a burden, it just felt like she cared. I guess that
         did deepen our relationship. But this feels different. It's like this need is so much
         bigger, so much scarier.

Therapist: What is it about this current situation with your partner that feels scarier than needing
           your friend after your grandma's passing - is it the nature of the need, the relationship
           itself, or something else entirely?


[8]

Patient: It's both. The need feels so much bigger, like it's going to consume me. And with my
         partner, I just... I care about them so much. I don't want to overwhelm them, you know?
         With my friend, it was different. I knew she could handle it. But with my partner, I
         just... I don't want to be too much. I don't want to lose them.

Therapist: What if your partner's love and commitment aren't conditional on you not being
           overwhelming, but rather, it's about their willingness to be present and supportive
           through all of life's challenges, including the messy ones?


[9]

Patient: That's a nice thought, but it's hard to wrap my head around. I just keep thinking, what if
         they get sick of it? What if they decide it's too much? I mean, I guess if they really love
         me, they'll stick around. But it's so hard to trust that. It's like I'm just waiting for
         the other shoe to drop.

Therapist: What if your worth and lovability aren't dependent on your partner's love, but rather,
           you are worthy of love and connection regardless of what happens with your partner - can
           you hold onto that thought, even if it's just for a moment?


[10]

Patient: I don't know. It's so hard to see that. I want to, but it's like there's this voice in my
         head telling me I'm not good enough. I'm trying to hold onto it, but it's slipping away.
         It's like I need something solid to hold onto, something real. But it's all just so...
         uncertain.

Therapist: What does that voice in your head say to you when it tells you you're not good enough -
           is it a specific phrase or message, and what do you think it's trying to protect you
           from?


[11]

Patient: It says I'm a mess, that I'm too much. It's like it's trying to protect me from being hurt,
         from being abandoned. Like if I can just keep everything together, then no one will leave.
         But it's so exhausting. And maybe it's not even true. I don't know anymore.

Therapist: That voice in your head sounds like it's trying to keep you safe from being hurt, but in
           doing so, it's actually causing a lot of suffering. Can you imagine this voice as a
           separate entity, like a roommate in your mind, and consider what its presence is costing
           you in terms of your relationships and your own well-being?


[12]

Patient: Yeah, I can see that. It's like having a helicopter parent in my head, always worried I'm
         going to get hurt. But it's costing me so much. I'm so guarded all the time, I can't even
         enjoy the relationships I have. I'm just always waiting for the next bad thing to happen.
         It's exhausting. And it's keeping me from being really close to anyone, even my partner.

Therapist: What would it take for you to imagine letting go of this critical voice, not to stop it
           from speaking, but to stop listening to it, and instead, trust yourself and your ability
           to handle whatever life brings - what would that look like for you?


[13]

Patient: I don't know if I can just let it go. It's been there for so long. But maybe, maybe I can
         start to question it more. Like, instead of just accepting what it says, maybe I can ask
         "is this really true?" Maybe I can start to challenge it, to see if it's really protecting
         me or if it's holding me back. Maybe then I can start to trust myself more. But it's so
         hard to even imagine. It's like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, and I'm terrified to
         jump.

Therapist: That's a big leap, but what if you didn't have to jump off the cliff all at once? What if
           you started by just questioning one small thing the critical voice says, like "I'm a
           mess" - what would happen if you said to yourself, "Is that really true?" and then saw
           what comes up for you?


[14]

Patient: Okay, I can try that. "I'm a mess." Is that really true? I mean, yeah, I'm struggling right
         now, but does that make me a mess? I don't know. Maybe it's just a story I've been telling
         myself. Maybe it's not as true as I thought. It's weird to even consider that.

Therapist: What if, instead of being a "mess," you were just a person who's struggling, but also
           strong, resilient, and capable of growth - what would that look like for you, and how
           would you start to see yourself in that light?


[15]

Patient: I guess if I'm not a mess, then I'm just... human. I'm a person going through a tough time.
         I've been through tough times before, and I've made it through. Maybe I can make it through
         this too. Maybe I can see myself as strong, even when I'm struggling. Maybe that's what
         being resilient is. It's a weird shift, but it feels... good. Like a weight lifted, at
         least a little bit.

Therapist: What if, from now on, when you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling, you remind yourself
           that you're not a mess, but a strong, capable person who's navigating a tough time - how
           might that change the way you approach your partner, your relationships, and your daily
           life?


[16]

Patient: That's a big question. I guess if I really believed that, I'd be kinder to myself, for
         starters. Maybe I wouldn't be so quick to snap at my partner. Maybe I'd be more open with
         them, too. I'd probably be more willing to ask for help, to lean on people. It's like I'd
         be giving myself permission to not have it all together all the time. That sounds... nice.
         But it's also scary. It's like I'd be admitting I'm vulnerable. That's the part that's
         hard.

Therapist: What if, instead of seeing vulnerability as a weakness, you saw it as a sign of courage
           and trust - trust in yourself, trust in your partner, and trust in the people around you
           - how might that change the way you approach vulnerability and ask for help?


[17]

Patient: Huh, I never thought of it that way. If vulnerability is courage, then... maybe it's not so
         scary. Maybe it's like saying, "I trust you with this part of me." Maybe it's even a
         strength. Maybe it's okay to ask for help, to say I'm not okay. Maybe that's what being
         strong really looks like. It's still hard to wrap my head around, but it's a interesting
         thought.

Therapist: What would it look like for you to start small, to take a tiny step towards asking for
           help or being vulnerable with your partner - maybe something as simple as sharing a
           difficult emotion or asking for a favor - what would that look like, and how might it
           feel?


[18]

Patient: Maybe I could start by just telling my partner I'm having a tough day. Not go into all the
         details, just say, "Hey, I'm struggling today." It's small, but it's something. I think it
         would feel scary, but also maybe... relieving? Like I don't have to pretend everything is
         okay all the time. Maybe they'd even appreciate it. I don't know. It's worth a shot, maybe.

Therapist: What if, when you say "I'm having a tough day" to your partner, they respond with
           understanding and support, and you feel a sense of relief and connection - what would
           that do for your relationship, and how might it change the way you interact with each
           other?


[19]

Patient: If they responded like that, I think I'd feel... seen. Like they really get me. I think it
         would bring us closer, make me feel safer with them. Maybe I wouldn't be so on edge all the
         time. Maybe we could just be more real with each other. That would be nice. Really nice.

Therapist: What if, as you become more comfortable with being vulnerable with your partner, you
           start to see that this openness and honesty can be applied to other areas of your life,
           like with friends, family, or even at work - what would that look like, and how might it
           impact your overall sense of connection and fulfillment?


[20]

Patient: If I could be more open in other areas... maybe I wouldn't feel so alone. Maybe I'd feel
         more connected, like people really know me. Maybe it wouldn't be so exhausting to keep up
         this facade all the time. It's scary to think about, but it's also exciting. Like maybe I
         could actually find some fulfillment, some joy. That would be really nice.

Therapist: What if, by being more open and honest with others, you're not just gaining connection
           and understanding, but also discovering a sense of purpose and meaning that's been hiding
           beneath the surface - what would that look like, and how might you start to explore that?
