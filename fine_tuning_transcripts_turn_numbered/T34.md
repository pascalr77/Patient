Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really on edge about getting together with
         friends. It's not that I don't want to see them, but the anxiety gets so bad that I end up
         avoiding it altogether. It's been tough, especially since I used to be the life of the
         party. I just don't know what to do about it.

Therapist: You've mentioned being the life of the party in the past, and now you're avoiding social
           events because of anxiety. What's the first thing that usually happens when you start
           thinking about going to a social gathering that makes you feel anxious?


[2]

Patient: Well, first thing that pops into my head is that I'll do something wrong, say the wrong
         thing. Like I'll blurt out something stupid or offensive. It's like my brain starts
         spinning with all the ways I could mess up.

Therapist: When these thoughts start spinning, what do you do with them? Do you try to push them
           away, or do you get caught up in them and start imagining all the worst-case scenarios?


[3]

Patient: I try to push them away, but it's like a snowball effect. Once it starts, it's hard to
         stop. I start imagining all the worst-case scenarios, like my friends getting upset or me
         making a fool of myself. It's exhausting, really.

Therapist: It sounds like those thoughts can be really overwhelming. What do you think would happen
           if you didn't try to push them away and just allowed yourself to have those thoughts -
           without judgment - what would you gain or lose in that moment?


[4]

Patient: I don't know, really. I guess I'm just worried that if I don't push them away, they'll get
         even bigger and worse. I mean, what's the point of just letting them float around in my
         head? Doesn't sound like that would help much.

Therapist: You're right that it might not feel helpful to just let the thoughts float around. But
           what about the value of connecting with your friends and having a good time with them?
           When you let these thoughts get in the way, what do you think you're missing out on, in
           terms of your relationships with them?


[5]

Patient: I suppose I'm missing out on just enjoying their company, having a good laugh. Those times
         used to be a great stress reliever, you know? Now it's like I'm stuck in my own head, even
         when I'm around them. It's tough.

Therapist: It sounds like enjoying your friends' company and having a good laugh used to bring you a
           lot of joy and stress relief. What would it take for you to start showing up in those
           social situations in a way that allows you to connect with your friends, even if you're
           feeling anxious, and find some of that joy again?


[6]

Patient: I wish I knew. Part of me just wants to flip a switch and be okay with it all, but it's not
         that easy. I guess maybe if I knew what to do when the anxiety starts up, maybe I could
         manage it better. But just thinking about that makes me feel a bit overwhelmed too.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of frustration with wanting to just "be okay" with things,
           but feeling like it's not that simple. Can you imagine allowing yourself to have anxiety,
           without trying to change it or get rid of it, and just seeing what happens when you show
           up in social situations with it?


[7]

Patient: I'm not sure I can. It's hard to imagine just letting it be. Feels like I should be doing
         something about it, right? I mean I've always been a problem solver, not sure how to just
         sit with something like this.

Therapist: You're someone who tends to be a problem solver, and it can be hard to give up on that
           approach. But acceptance isn't about solving the problem of anxiety; it's more about
           being willing to be with the anxiety itself, even if it's uncomfortable. Can you think of
           a time when you've had to accept something outside of your control, like the weather or a
           traffic jam, and what that was like for you?


[8]

Patient: I guess when my partner got ill and had to spend time in the hospital, that was pretty
         huge. There was nothing I could do about it. It was a waiting game. I just had to be there
         by their side and ride through the uncertainty of it all.

Therapist: That's a really tough situation, and it sounds like you were able to be present with your
           partner during that time, even when there was uncertainty. Can you think about how being
           with your partner in the hospital might be similar to being with your anxiety in social
           situations - both involve uncertainty, but also the possibility of connection and being
           present with others?


[9]

Patient: I suppose I see what you're getting at, but it's different, you know? The hospital was
         about being there for someone else. This anxiety, it's all inside me. It's me being a mess.
         Not sure how to just "be with it" when it feels like I'm the problem.

Therapist: It's true that the hospital experience was about being there for someone else, but what
           if you considered that being with your anxiety is also a form of being there for
           yourself? Can you imagine treating yourself with the same kind of compassion and
           acceptance that you showed your partner in the hospital, even when you're feeling anxious
           and uncertain about yourself?


[10]

Patient: I never really thought about it that way. It's still hard to wrap my head around. So you're
         saying just be kind to myself? Easier said than done, doc.

Therapist: It's not always easy, and it's not about being kind to yourself as a one-time thing, but
           rather as a practice. What if you were to approach yourself with kindness and
           understanding, not because you're perfect or have it all together, but because you're
           human and struggling with anxiety? Can you imagine what that would look like in your
           daily life, especially when you're feeling anxious?


[11]

Patient: I dunno, maybe just acknowledging that I'm having a tough time instead of beating myself up
         about it? Like, saying to myself "okay, this is hard but I can be here, I can do this" and
         not trying to force it away. It's weird to even think about, to be honest.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see the value in acknowledging your struggles and being
           kind to yourself. What if you were to take that approach into your social interactions,
           especially when you're feeling anxious? Could you imagine showing up to those situations
           with a sense of "I'm here, I'm struggling, but I'm going to try to be present" rather
           than "I'm going to try to be perfect and avoid making a mistake"?


[12]

Patient: Yeah, maybe. It's still scary, doc. I want to run away from it, not just dive in headfirst.
         It's like you're asking me to just accept I might make a fool of myself.

Therapist: I'm not asking you to dive in headfirst, but rather to take small steps towards being
           present and kind to yourself in social situations. What if you were to start small, like
           going to a low-stakes social gathering, like a coffee date with a friend, and see how
           that feels? Could you imagine taking a tiny step towards showing up as yourself, even if
           it's not perfect?


[13]

Patient: Maybe I could do that. Coffee with just one friend, that's not too scary. But what if they
         ask me why I've been avoiding everyone? I don't want to lie but I also don't want to make a
         big deal out of it.

Therapist: It's natural to worry about how others might react, but what if you saw it as an
           opportunity to be honest and authentic with your friend? You could say something like,
           "Hey, I've been feeling really anxious about social stuff lately, and I've been avoiding
           it. I'm trying to work on being more present and open, but it's still tough for me." What
           do you think your friend's response might be if you were to be honest with them about
           your struggles?


[14]

Patient: I guess they'd be understanding. They know I've been having a hard time. Still, it's weird
         to just put it all out there, you know? Feels like I'm admitting I'm broken or something.

Therapist: It's understandable that it feels vulnerable to share your struggles, but what if you saw
           it as a sign of strength, rather than weakness? Being open and honest about your
           challenges can actually bring people closer together and create deeper connections. Would
           you be willing to try re-framing your thinking around vulnerability, so that it's not
           something to be ashamed of, but rather something that allows you to be more authentic and
           connected with others?


[15]

Patient: I dunno, maybe. It's just hard to see it that way, like I'm not just complaining or being a
         downer, you know? I guess I could try to think of it like that. It's just, what if they do
         think I'm weak. That's hard too.

Therapist: It's natural to worry about how others might perceive us, but what if you could separate
           their opinions from your own worth and identity? You are more than your anxiety and your
           struggles. You are a person with strengths, values, and relationships that are worth
           sharing and connecting with others over. Can you imagine letting go of the need for
           others' approval and instead focusing on being true to yourself, even if that means being
           vulnerable?


[16]

Patient: Yeah I get that, it's just not that simple. I mean, I want to, but there's still that voice
         saying 'what if they judge you?'. It's stuck in my head, you know? Really hard to shake it
         sometimes.

Therapist: That critical voice can be really persistent, can't it? What do you think that voice is
           trying to protect you from, or what's its goal in warning you about potential judgment?
           Is it trying to keep you safe from potential harm, or is it actually holding you back
           from connecting with others and living in a way that's authentic to you?


[17]

Patient: Guess it thinks it's keeping me safe, but really it's just making things worse. I mean, I'm
         so caught up in my head I can't even enjoy time with my friends. It's like I'm watching
         life from a window instead of actually living it. But telling that voice to shut up hasn't
         really worked, so I don't know what to do.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see that the critical voice might be getting in the way
           of living the life you want. Instead of trying to shut it up, what if you were to see it
           as a part of you that's trying to protect you, but perhaps not in the most effective way?
           Can you imagine learning to coexist with that voice, rather than trying to silence it,
           and finding ways to live your life in a way that honors your values and goals despite its
           presence?


[18]

Patient: I'm not sure what that would look like, honestly. It's like, okay, I hear the voice, but
         then what? How do I just live with it? It's not like I can just ignore it either. Feels
         like I'm stuck with it, so what do I do? Just acknowledge it and move on? Easier said than
         done.

Therapist: You're right, it's not always easy to just acknowledge and move on, but it's a skill that
           can be developed over time with practice. One way to start is to try a simple phrase like
           "I hear you, critical voice" when you notice it popping up. Then, take a deep breath and
           ask yourself, "What's the next step I can take towards living the life I want?" It might
           be small, like taking a few deep breaths, or it might be bigger, like reaching out to a
           friend. What do you think about trying that approach?


[19]

Patient: I guess I can give it a shot.

Therapist: That's a great place to start. Remember, it's not about silencing the critical voice
           completely, but about learning to coexist with it and take action towards living a life
           that's true to you. I'd like to give you a homework assignment: for the next week,
           whenever you notice the critical voice, try saying "I hear you, critical voice" and take
           one small step towards living in alignment with your values. How does that sound?


[20]

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. Can't promise anything, but I'll do my best.

Therapist: That's all I can ask for. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about taking small
           steps towards living a life that's true to you. Be kind to yourself as you work on this,
           and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Just acknowledge the slip-up and try
           again. You got this.
