Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. It's like there's this heavy sadness hanging
         over me all the time, and I just can't find the motivation to do anything. I think it's
         mostly because of the financial stress I've been under. It's even started to affect my
         relationship.

Therapist: That heavy sadness sounds really suffocating. How has the financial stress specifically
           affected your relationship with your partner, and what do you think is the most
           challenging part of navigating this stress together?


[2]

Patient: I've just been so irritable and distant lately. My partner tries to help, but I snap at
         them all the time. I feel stuck being unhappy but I don't want to burden them. It's like
         the stress is always there, even when we're supposed to be enjoying time together. It's
         just... exhausting. I don't know how to break out of this cycle of financial worry and lack
         of energy to fix any of this.

Therapist: It sounds like being irritable and snapping at your partner is really taking a toll on
           your relationship. What do you think snapping at your partner does for you in those
           moments, even if it's not the healthiest way to communicate?


[3]

Patient: I think it's just a release, really. Like a momentary escape from all the tension I'm
         feeling. It's not fair to my partner, and I always regret it afterwards. But when I'm
         feeling that way, I just want to push everything and everyone away.

Therapist: It sounds like pushing everything and everyone away is a way to temporarily escape the
           tension you're feeling, but it ultimately leaves you feeling worse. What is it about
           being around others or being connected that feels so overwhelming to you right now?


[4]

Patient: It's just so much effort to pretend I'm okay, even though I know people care and want to
         help. I just don't have the energy for it, and I've been feeling so negative and like a
         failure, dealing with finances and my lack of motivation. It's embarrassing talking to
         people, even my partner, about all the stress I'm under. It's like I'm stuck in this dark
         cloud, and I don't want to bring anyone else down with me.

Therapist: That sense of shame and embarrassment can be really paralyzing. What does it mean to you
           to be a "failure" right now, and what's the worst thing that would happen if you were to
           open up about your struggles to your partner or others?


[5]

Patient: I've always been able to handle things, and being a teacher, I'm supposed to have it all
         together, right? But this time, it's like I can't fix this, can't fix how I feel, no matter
         how hard I try. I have a partner who is so caring and involved, but I guess I fear that if
         I open up and show just how much I'm struggling, they might see me differently. Like they
         might finally realize I'm not as strong or capable as they thought. Or, worse, that I'm
         just too much to deal with. I don't want to be a burden, but I feel like I am.

Therapist: It sounds like you're afraid that being open about your struggles would change how your
           partner sees you, like they'd lose respect for you or think you're too much to handle.
           What would you most fear losing in your relationship if your partner saw you as
           vulnerable and in need of help?


[6]

Patient: I think I'm most afraid of losing the dynamic we have, the equality. I don't want them to
         see me as weak or needy. I want to be their partner, their rock, not someone they have to
         take care of. I fear that if they see how much I'm struggling, they might start to treat me
         differently, and I don't want their pity. I want their respect and support but it's hard
         for me to see how that support can look like right now.

Therapist: It sounds like being the "rock" in the relationship is a crucial part of your identity
           and sense of self-worth. What would it mean to you to ask for and receive support from
           your partner, rather than trying to be the one providing it, and how might that change
           the way you see yourself and your relationship?


[7]

Patient: I'm not sure, really. I've always been the one people come to for help and advice. It's
         hard to imagine it the other way around, especially in my relationship. If I'm not the
         strong one, then who am I? It's scary to think about. I worry that needing support might
         make me feel even smaller and more like a failure, but I can't keep going like this and I'm
         just so unsure what our relationship would look like if I open up.

Therapist: What is it about feeling "smaller" that's so scary for you, and what's the worst that
           would happen if you were to admit to yourself that you need support and guidance right
           now?


[8]

Patient: It's just that I've always been the one in control, the one helping others. Feeling
         "smaller" means feeling weak, vulnerable. I'm afraid that if I admit I need support, I'll
         just crumble. That I won't be able to handle it if I let myself feel all this stuff I've
         been trying to hold back. But I think the worst thing is maybe that I might realize I'm not
         as strong as I thought I was. That maybe it wasn't just the financial stress but something
         wrong with me all along. It's just all so uncertain and that's the hardest part.

Therapist: It sounds like your sense of identity is closely tied to being strong and in control.
           What if, instead of trying to prove your strength, you were to approach this situation
           with curiosity and kindness towards yourself, rather than judgment?


[9]

Patient: Easier said than done. I've been so hard on myself for so long, it's hard to imagine any
         other way. But I suppose if I could just be a little kinder to myself, maybe I wouldn't
         feel so stuck. I'm not sure I know how, but maybe it might help.

Therapist: That's a good place to start. When you say you'd like to be kinder to yourself, what does
           that mean in concrete terms? Would you be willing to say something kind to yourself right
           now, in this moment, as we're talking about this?


[10]

Patient: I guess it means not beating myself up so much, maybe letting go of this idea of how I
         "should" be handling things, but it's hard. Right now, though, maybe I can say that... I'm
         doing the best I can. That it's okay to struggle, and it's okay to need help. Even if it
         doesn't feel like it sometimes.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage to say. If you were to live with this perspective - that it's
           okay to struggle and need help - how might that change the way you show up in your
           relationship with your partner, and what kind of interactions might become more possible
           for you?


[11]

Patient: It might make me more open, I guess. Maybe I wouldn't be so quick to brush them off when
         they try to help. Maybe I'd actually talk to them about what I'm going through, instead of
         just saying "I'm fine." That's hard.

Therapist: That sounds like a really different way of being in your relationship. What would you
           hope to gain or achieve by being more open with your partner, and how might that impact
           your connection with them?


[12]

Patient: I hope maybe I'd feel less alone. Like I don't have to carry all this by myself. Maybe it
         would help us feel more connected, you know? Like we're a team again. I don't know if it'll
         work but part of me hopes it might. It's just so hard to imagine opening up like that, to
         let someone see me in pain.

Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful vision for your relationship. What would it mean to you to
           feel truly seen and understood by your partner, and how might that change the way you
           show up in your life and your relationship in the long run?


[13]

Patient: I guess it would mean I don't have to hide anymore. That I can just be myself, all of
         myself, and that's okay. I think maybe I'd feel more settled, more at peace. Like I don't
         have to put on a facade, don't have to be the strong one all the time. Maybe we could just
         be together, as we are, and that would be enough.

Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful sense of freedom and connection. What's the first step you
           can imagine taking to start moving towards this vision of being your authentic self with
           your partner, without having to hide or be the strong one all the time?


[14]

Patient: I guess maybe just talking to them. Telling them I'm struggling. I don't know if I can do
         it right away, but maybe I can start small. Maybe just say, "I've not been feeling like
         myself lately." Just a little bit at a time. It's going to be hard, but the alternative is
         staying stuck in this lonely place. I don't want to do that anymore. It's just really scary
         to think about being that vulnerable but I do want to try.

Therapist: That's a great start. "I've not been feeling like myself lately" is a gentle and honest
           way to begin the conversation. What do you think would happen if you were to have this
           conversation with your partner, and what kind of support or response might you hope for
           from them?


[15]

Patient: I don't know what will happen. I guess I'm scared they might be surprised, you know? Like
         they didn't realize I was struggling. And I guess I hope... I hope they'll just listen.
         Maybe hold me. Tell me they're there for me. That they understand. I don't need them to fix
         anything, just... be there.

Therapist: It sounds like what you're really craving is a sense of being seen and held by your
           partner, without having to be the strong one. Would you be willing to take a chance on
           that, to see if your partner can meet you in this vulnerable place and offer the support
           you're craving?


[16]

Patient: I think so. I mean, I want to. It's just so hard to actually do. But I think I need to. I
         can't keep going like this, feeling so alone and stuck. So, yeah, I'll try. I'll talk to
         them.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage. I'm here to support you, and I'll be here with you as you
           take this step. What do you need from me in this moment, before you talk to your partner?


[17]

Patient: I guess I just need to know I'm not crazy for feeling this way. That it's okay to need
         this. That I deserve to be supported, even if it's hard for me to ask for it. It's so hard
         to imagine letting go of this facade of being the strong one, but I want to believe it's
         possible.

Therapist: You are not crazy for feeling this way. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your
           struggles and to want something different. And you are deserving of support, regardless
           of whether it's hard for you to ask for it. In fact, asking for support is a sign of
           strength, not weakness. You are worthy of love, care, and connection, and it's okay to
           ask for it.


[18]

Patient: Okay. Thank you. I'll try to remember that. It's still scary, but maybe it doesn't have to
         be so hard. Maybe I can just start small, like you said. Maybe that'll make it easier.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember that you're not alone in this journey, and that
           it's okay to take things at your own pace. You've already taken a big step by
           acknowledging your struggles and wanting to make a change. Keep going, and be gentle with
           yourself along the way.


[19]

Patient: Okay, I'll try. One step at a time, right? It's still hard. I still feel scared. But maybe
         I can do this. Maybe it'll be okay.

Therapist: You're doing it. You're taking small steps towards a more authentic and connected life,
           and that takes a lot of courage. Remember that it's okay to feel scared and unsure, but
           it's also okay to keep moving forward, one step at a time. You got this.


[20]

Patient: Thanks. I just feel so unsure, like I'm walking on shaky ground. But I'll keep trying. One
         step at a time, like you said. I just hope it gets easier.

Therapist: That's completely normal, feeling unsure and like you're walking on shaky ground. It's a
           brave and vulnerable place to be, but it's also a place of great growth and possibility.
           Remember that it's okay to feel uncertain, and that it's okay to take things one step at
           a time. You're not alone in this, and you're doing the best you can. That's something to
           be proud of.
