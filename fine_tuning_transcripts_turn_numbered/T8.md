# Transcript T8

[1]

Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. Since the big argument with my family, I just
         can't shake off this sadness. It's like I've lost my motivation for everything, even work
         has been tough. I'm not sure what to do about it.

Therapist: That sadness and loss of motivation can be really tough to deal with. What specific parts
           of your daily life have you found yourself withdrawing from or having less interest in
           since the argument, even if it's just small things, like a hobby or a social activity?


[2]

Patient: I've just been going through the motions at work. I used to enjoy reading and going for
         walks, but now I just don't have the energy or interest. I've also been dodging calls from
         friends, I just don't feel like talking to anyone. It's all a bit of a blur, really.

Therapist: When you say you don't feel like talking to anyone, what are you hoping to achieve or
           avoid by not engaging with your friends right now?


[3]

Patient: I just don't want to bother them with my problems. They have their own lives to worry
         about. I guess I'm just trying to avoid being a burden. And honestly, I'm not sure what to
         say to them anyway.

Therapist: That makes sense that you wouldn't want to burden them. But when you avoid reaching out
           to your friends, does that leave you feeling more alone or connected to them in some way,
           even if it's just a sense of relief?


[4]

Patient: It just leaves me feeling more alone. Like I'm stuck in this bubble of sadness and I can't
         reach out, can't ask for help, even if I know I probably should. I don't want to trouble
         them, but it's not like it's helping me either, being all by myself like this.

Therapist: What's one thing that's been missing from your life right now that you feel is really
           important, something that you're not getting by being isolated, and that you might be
           willing to take small steps towards getting back into, even if it feels scary or
           uncertain?


[5]

Patient: I guess I miss just having someone to talk to, even about nothing important. Just that
         everyday connection. But I don't know, it feels weird to just call someone up and start
         chatting after all this time. I guess I could start small, maybe just send a message or
         something. See where it goes.

Therapist: That sounds like a great place to start - sending a message can be a small, low-stakes
           way to reconnect. What would you say to yourself if you were trying to convince yourself
           to send that message, and what would be the worst that could happen if you did?


[6]

Patient: I'd probably tell myself to just do it, stop overthinking. It's just a message, not a big
         deal. The worst that could happen? I guess they might not respond, or maybe they'd say
         they're busy. It's not like they'd be mean or anything. I just don't want to come across as
         needy or desperate.

Therapist: When you worry about coming across as needy or desperate, what are you afraid might
           happen if the other person perceives you that way?


[7]

Patient: I guess I'm afraid they might pity me. Or maybe they'd start avoiding me too. I don't want
         to be that person everyone feels sorry for. I've always been the strong one, the one who
         helps others. I don't want that to change.

Therapist: It sounds like being seen as strong and helpful is really important to you, and that's
           led you to avoid reaching out for help when you need it. How do you think this identity
           as the strong one has been working out for you lately, especially given how you're
           feeling right now?


[8]

Patient: Not great, to be honest. I mean, it's good to be strong for others, but right now, I feel
         like I'm crumbling on the inside. It's exhausting, pretending to be okay all the time.
         Something's got to give. I just don't know what else to do.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to pretend to be okay or strong all the time, you allowed
           yourself to be exactly where you are right now - crumbling, feeling overwhelmed, and
           unsure? What would that look like, and what might be some benefits of being more honest
           with yourself and others about how you're really feeling?


[9]

Patient: I don't know. I guess it would be a relief not to have to put on a show all the time. But
         it also feels scary. I'm not sure what people would think of me. Maybe they'd understand
         better why I've been so distant. Maybe I'd understand myself better too. But it's hard to
         just let go like that.

Therapist: What's one value that's really important to you, something that feels like it's being
           compromised by all the pretending and hiding?


[10]

Patient: Honesty. I've always prided myself on being truthful. But lately, it feels like I'm just
         lying to everyone, including myself. It doesn't sit right with me.

Therapist: Given how important honesty is to you, what would it take for you to start being honest
           with others and yourself about how you're really feeling, even if it's hard or
           uncomfortable?


[11]

Patient: I think I'd need to just take it one step at a time. Maybe start by just admitting to
         myself when I'm not okay, instead of brushing it off. Then maybe I could try being honest
         with someone else, just a little bit at a time. It's not going to be easy, but I think it's
         something I need to do. I just don't want to feel like I'm lying anymore.

Therapist: That sounds like a good plan - taking it one step at a time. What small step can you take
           today or this week to start being more honest with yourself, even if it's just a tiny
           admission to yourself about how you're feeling?


[12]

Patient: I can start by just saying it out loud when I'm alone. Just admit, "I'm not okay right
         now." Maybe write it down too. Just something small, when no one's around. That way, it's
         just me, no pressure from anyone else.

Therapist: That's a great idea - saying it out loud and writing it down can help make it feel more
           real and tangible. What do you think would happen if, after saying "I'm not okay right
           now," you then took a moment to explore what that means, what's behind it, and what you
           need in that moment?


[13]

Patient: I don't know. I guess I might figure out what's really bothering me. Maybe I'd realize I
         need something I didn't know I needed. Or maybe I'd just feel more overwhelmed. It's worth
         a shot, I suppose. But it's scary too. What if I find out something I don't want to know?

Therapist: What if, instead of thinking about what you might discover, you focus on the idea that
           you're capable of handling whatever comes up? What would it take for you to trust
           yourself to be able to handle whatever you find out about yourself?


[14]

Patient: I guess I'd need to remember all the times I've faced tough stuff before and gotten through
         it. I've dealt with a lot in my life, I know I can handle more. It's just hard to remember
         that when I'm feeling so low. But maybe if I just take a moment to remind myself, to really
         believe it, I could trust myself more.

Therapist: That's a great starting point - acknowledging your past resilience and reminding yourself
           of it. What would it take for you to make this a more automatic process, so that when
           you're feeling low, you can quickly recall your past experiences and trust yourself to
           handle it?


[15]

Patient: I think I'd need to make it a habit. Maybe write down some of the things I've been through,
         how I dealt with them. Read it over every day. Put it somewhere I can see it. Just
         something to remind me that I'm stronger than I feel sometimes. I don't know if it'll work,
         but I guess it's worth trying.

Therapist: That sounds like a great idea - writing down your successes and reminding yourself of
           them regularly. What do you think would happen if, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you
           didn't try to fix the problem right away, but instead took a few minutes to read over
           your list and remind yourself of your strengths and past accomplishments?


[16]

Patient: I don't know. I think it might help calm me down at least. Maybe let me see the problem
         from a different angle. But it's not like it'll make the problem go away. I don't want to
         just ignore stuff, I want to fix it. But I guess taking a step back couldn't hurt.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have - wanting to tackle the problem head-on. What if, before
           you start trying to fix the problem, you took just one minute to take a few deep breaths,
           notice your thoughts and feelings, and ask yourself what you really need in that moment
           to feel more grounded and clear?


[17]

Patient: I don't know if that'll help. I mean, I get it, but when I'm upset, I just want to do
         something, not just sit there and breathe. But I guess it couldn't hurt to try. Might help
         me think a bit clearer. I just don't want to feel like I'm wasting time, you know? But
         maybe if it helps me think better, it's not a waste. I can try it, see what happens.

Therapist: What if, instead of thinking of taking a minute to breathe as a waste of time, you
           thought of it as a way to invest in yourself, to make sure you're showing up to your
           problems in the best way possible?


[18]

Patient: Never thought of it that way. Investing in myself, huh? I guess that makes sense. If I can
         think better, I can act better too. Alright, I can try it. No promises, but I'll give it a
         shot. See how it goes.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to give it a shot. Remember, it's not about being perfect or
           getting it right all the time, but about taking care of yourself and showing up to your
           life in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you.


[19]

Patient: Yeah, yeah. I get it. No pressure, right? Easier said than done, but I'll try. That's all I
         can do, really. Just take it one thing at a time. See how it goes.

Therapist: That's exactly right - taking it one thing at a time. And I think that's a great place to
           end our session for today. You've made some progress and taken some important steps
           towards taking care of yourself. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you're ready
           to continue this work.


[20]

Patient: Alright. Thanks. I'll think about what we talked about. See you next time.

Therapist: Sounds good. I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care of yourself until then.
