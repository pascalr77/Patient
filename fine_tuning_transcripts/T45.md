# Transcript T45

Patient: Hi, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really struggling with getting stuck in these loops of beating myself up. I feel like I've always been so independent, and any time I feel like I've failed, I just can't seem to ask for help. It's been really tough.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me about a specific situation recently where you felt like you had to handle things on your own, even when you might have wanted or needed help, and what happened as a result?

Patient: I think the most recent example would be when I was preparing for my classroom observations this year. I was really struggling with designing lesson plans that would accommodate all my students' needs. I knew I could ask other teachers or even the principal for help, they've always been supportive and open to collaboration. But I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I felt like I should be able to handle it on my own, that it was my responsibility and mine alone. Eventually, I managed to get it all done, but I was completely exhausted and still felt like I could have done better. I just kept thinking, "Why couldn't you just figure this out sooner?" and that just made me feel even worse. It's like I can't accept that I might need help sometimes.

Therapist: It sounds like asking for help feels deeply tied to your sense of responsibility and ability to do your job well. Can you tell me more about what's most important to you in your role as a teacher, and how being able to ask for help might fit into those values?

Patient: I think what's most important to me as a teacher is being able to support my students and help them grow. I want to be someone they can rely on, and that means being prepared and knowing what I'm doing. If I ask for help, it feels like I'm admitting that I'm not good enough at my job, like I'm letting them down. But at the same time, I know that if I'm constantly exhausted and struggling, I can't be the best teacher for them either. It's just hard to see where asking for help fits into all of that.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a bit of a paradox here - you want to be a reliable teacher for your students, but the way you're thinking about asking for help is actually undermining that goal. When you say "I'm not good enough at my job" or "I'm letting them down," those thoughts are like a kind of mental shorthand that might be getting in the way. Can you notice what happens when you think those thoughts, and what they're trying to protect you from?

Patient: When I think "I'm not good enough" or "I'm letting them down," I feel this immediate sense of dread and anxiety. It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I think, on some level, those thoughts are trying to protect me from failure or from looking weak in front of others. They push me to work harder and do better. But at the same time, they also make me feel really isolated and stuck in my own head. It's like I'm constantly fighting against myself, and it's exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like those thoughts are creating a lot of tension and making it hard for you to take action. When you're feeling that dread and anxiety, can you try to take a step back and observe those thoughts without getting caught up in them? What would happen if, instead of fighting against those thoughts, you simply allowed them to be there, like a wave passing through, while you focus on what you value - supporting your students and being a good teacher?

Patient: If I could just let those thoughts be there without getting stuck in them, I think I might feel a bit more at ease. Maybe I wouldn't feel so locked up and tense all the time. But that's really hard for me to do. Those thoughts feel so real and true in the moment. I don't know if I can just ignore them. Plus, if I did, I feel like I might lose that drive to keep pushing myself to do better.

Therapist: Let's explore what "doing better" means to you. When you say you want to push yourself to do better, what does that look like in terms of supporting your students and being a good teacher? Is it about getting a certain grade or feedback, or is it about something more intrinsic, like making a positive impact on their lives?

Patient: I guess for me, "doing better" means really making a difference in my students' lives. It's not just about the grades or the feedback, although those things can be important too. It's more about seeing my students grow and develop as individuals, knowing that I played a part in that. I want to inspire them to love learning, to help them build confidence, and to support them through whatever challenges they might be facing. But I think sometimes I get so caught up in trying to be perfect that I lose sight of that bigger picture. Like maybe I focus too much on having the perfect lesson plan instead of being present with my students and responding to what they actually need.

Therapist: It sounds like you're describing a bit of a disconnect between your goals and your actions. You want to make a difference in your students' lives, but your focus on being perfect is actually getting in the way. What would happen if, instead of trying to have the perfect lesson plan, you focused on being present with your students and responding to their needs in the moment? What might you do differently, and how might that align more closely with your values?

Patient: If I focused more on being present with my students, I think I'd be more flexible and adaptable in the classroom. I might be more open to spontaneous discussions or activities that weren't part of my original plan, but that could still help my students grow and learn. I think I'd be better at listening to them and understanding what they really need from me. That feels a bit scary, because it means letting go of some control and trusting myself more. But it also feels more aligned with who I want to be as a teacher, and what I want my students to gain from our time together.

Therapist: That sounds like a really exciting possibility. If you were to focus more on being present and adaptable in the classroom, how do you think that would change the way you relate to yourself? Would you feel more confident in your ability to make decisions and trust your instincts, or would you still be worried about being "good enough"?

Patient: I think if I could be more present and adaptable, I might start to trust myself more. Maybe I wouldn't be so hard on myself all the time, because I'd see that I can handle whatever comes up, even if it's not what I planned for. But I think that worry about being "good enough" would still be there, at least at first. It's just so ingrained in me. I don't think it's going to disappear overnight. I guess I'd have to keep reminding myself that making mistakes or asking for help doesn't make me a bad teacher.

Therapist: That's a great start. Reminding yourself that making mistakes or asking for help doesn't make you a bad teacher is a good first step. But what if, instead of just reminding yourself of that, you actually allowed yourself to feel the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with being a human being in a challenging situation? What if you could be kind to yourself when you make mistakes, and acknowledge that it's okay not to have all the answers?

Patient: That sounds really hard. I'm not sure I know how to do that. I mean, I get it in theory, but actually feeling uncertain and doubting myself without trying to push it away or "fix" it? That feels really vulnerable. I think I'd be afraid that if I allowed myself to feel that way, I'd just end up feeling even worse about myself. But at the same time, I guess I can see how always trying to push those feelings away might be making things worse too.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between two fears: the fear of feeling worse about yourself, and the fear of not being able to handle uncertainty. But what if, instead of trying to avoid those feelings, you could actually use them as an opportunity to connect with your students on a deeper level? What if, by being more vulnerable and uncertain, you could create a safe space for your students to be vulnerable and uncertain too?

Patient: I never really thought about it that way. If I could model being vulnerable and uncertain for my students, maybe they'd feel more comfortable taking risks and making mistakes too. I guess that could be a good thing. But it still feels really scary. I'm not sure I'm ready to be that vulnerable with them, or even with myself. What if I can't handle it? What if I fall apart?

Therapist: What does "falling apart" mean to you in this context? Is it about losing control, losing your job, or something else? And what would happen if, instead of trying to prevent yourself from "falling apart," you were to allow yourself to be in the midst of uncertainty and vulnerability, and still found a way to show up for your students?

Patient: I think "falling apart" means feeling so overwhelmed and out of control that I can't function. Like I'd be a mess, and everyone would see it, and then they'd know that I'm not really as put together as I seem. I guess I'm worried that if I allow myself to be vulnerable, that's what will happen. But if I could still show up for my students, even in the midst of all that...I'm not sure how that would work, honestly. It's hard to imagine. Maybe they'd see that it's okay to not have it all together all the time? Maybe it would even help them to see me struggle and keep going? I don't know. It's still really scary to think about.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about being seen as imperfect, and that's making it hard for you to be vulnerable. But what if, instead of trying to appear "put together," you were to see yourself as a complex, multifaceted person who can handle uncertainty and imperfection? What if you could see yourself as a teacher who shows up, not because you have it all together, but because you're committed to your students and your values, even when it's hard?

Patient: I like the sound of that, but it's still hard to wrap my head around. I think I've been telling myself for so long that I have to be perfect, it's like I don't know how to be anything else. But I guess if I could see myself that way, as someone who can handle imperfection, maybe I wouldn't be so hard on myself all the time. Maybe I could be a little kinder, a little more patient. But it's still really hard to imagine actually doing that. How do I get from where I am now to that point?

Therapist: Let's start small. Can you think of one specific situation this week where you might be tempted to be hard on yourself, but instead, you could try to be kind and compassionate? Maybe it's something as simple as making a mistake in front of your students, or not having all the answers. What would you do, and how would you talk to yourself in that moment?

Patient: Okay, maybe this Friday I have a big project planned with my students, and I know things often don't go as planned. Maybe if something goes wrong, instead of beating myself up and thinking "I should have done better," I could take a breath and say something like, "This is a challenge, but it's okay. I can handle this. Let's find a way to make this work." I guess I could acknowledge that it's tough, but also remind myself that it's alright not to be perfect.

Therapist: That's a great start. Now, let's imagine that this Friday, something does go wrong with the project, and you're feeling frustrated and tempted to be hard on yourself. Can you take a moment to mentally rehearse what you would say to yourself in that moment, and how you would respond to the situation? What would you say to yourself, and what would you do next?

Patient: Okay, so let's say the students are really struggling with the project, and I'm feeling like I didn't prepare them well enough. I can feel my heart racing and that familiar voice in my head saying, "You should have done more. You're failing them." But instead of going down that spiral, I take a deep breath and tell myself, "It's okay to struggle. This is a challenge, not a failure. Let's find a way to make this work together." Then, maybe I'd ask my students, "What's one thing that's tough about this project? Let's brainstorm some ways to tackle that together."

Therapist: That's a great plan. Now, let's make a commitment to yourself to act on this new response when it happens. Can you commit to taking that deep breath, saying those words to yourself, and asking your students for their input when you feel that familiar voice of self-doubt rising up? What specific action will you take to make this commitment a reality?

Patient: I'm not sure I can commit to remembering to do this every single time, but I think I can promise to try. Maybe I could write it down on a notecard and keep it in my pocket, or even set a reminder on my phone. Something to help me remember that it's okay to struggle, and that I can ask for help. I guess that's my specific action - I'll set a reminder to go off right before class starts on Friday, just to help me keep this in mind. Baby steps, right?

Therapist: That's a great start, and I love the idea of taking it one step at a time. Remembering to take a few deep breaths and ask for help is a huge step, and it's something you can build on. Let's make a plan to check in with yourself after Friday's class and see how it went. How would you like to celebrate if you're able to stick to your plan and respond in a more compassionate way?

Patient: I'm not really sure. I guess I could treat myself to something nice, like a good book or a relaxing bath. But honestly, I think just knowing that I was able to do it would feel like a celebration in and of itself. Let's see how it goes first. I don't want to get too ahead of myself.

Therapist: I love that attitude. Focusing on the process and the small wins is a great way to cultivate a growth mindset. Let's just take it one step at a time and see how it goes. Remember, it's not about being perfect or achieving some kind of outcome, it's about showing up and being kind to yourself in the midst of uncertainty.

Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. I think I can try that. One step at a time.

Therapist: Remember, this is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to make mistakes along the way. The important thing is that you're showing up and being willing to learn and grow. Keep in mind that self-compassion and self-awareness are skills that take practice, and that it's okay to be gentle with yourself as you work on them.

Patient: Okay, I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard, you know? I want to be better, but I also want to be okay with where I am. It's like I'm always stuck in the middle. But I guess that's part of the journey too.

Therapist: That's a beautiful insight. Being in the middle, between wanting to improve and accepting yourself as you are, is a place of growth and learning. It's okay to be in this space, and it's actually where the most important work happens. Can you see that accepting yourself as you are right now doesn't mean you're giving up on becoming a better teacher, but rather that you're being kind to yourself in the present moment, and trusting that you'll continue to grow and learn?

Patient: I think I can see that, yeah. It's just hard to hold both things at the same time. I want to be better, but I also want to be okay with who I am right now. I guess if I can see it as a journey, then it's okay to be in the middle. It's okay to not have it all figured out yet. That's what growth is, right?

Therapist: That's exactly right. Growth is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to not have it all figured out yet. You're not just a teacher, you're a human being who is learning and growing every day. And that's what makes you a great teacher - your willingness to learn and adapt. Can you see that this mindset can benefit you in many areas of your life, not just your teaching?

Patient: Maybe. I mean, I guess it makes sense. Like, if I can be kind to myself and accept that I'm learning and growing as a teacher, maybe I can do that in other areas too. It's just hard to imagine. Like I'm not sure what that looks like for me.

Therapist: Let's explore what it would mean to live more in line with this mindset in other areas of your life. What are some areas where you feel like you're being too hard on yourself, or where you're struggling to accept yourself as you are? What would it look like to be kind and compassionate towards yourself in those areas, and what values would you be living into by doing so?
