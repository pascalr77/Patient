# Transcript T27

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been feeling really on edge, more so than usual. Ever since I moved, everything seems to set me off, whether it's the movers, the landlord, or even my neighbors. I've always been able to brush things off, but now, it's like I can't control my anger, and it's starting to worry me. I find myself snapping at people, and that's not who I want to be.

Therapist: You've been feeling really on edge lately, and it's affecting how you interact with others. What's changed the most for you since the move that you think might be contributing to feeling like you're snapping at people?

Patient: Well, pretty much everything has changed. New job, new city, new apartment. I don't know anyone here, so I guess it's just the stress of it all. I mean, I've moved before, but this time it feels like every little thing is setting me off. Like, the landlord took forever to fix a leak, and I just blew up at him. That's not me, or at least it didn't used to be.

Therapist: You mentioned that you feel like you're snapping at people, and it's not who you want to be. Can you tell me more about who you think you used to be in terms of how you handled stress and difficult situations, and how that's different from who you feel like you are now?

Patient: I used to be the kind of person who could let things roll off my back. At work, in the ER, stuff would hit the fan constantly, and I'd just handle it, you know? I could joke around, make others laugh, and keep my cool even when things got tough. But now, it's like every little thing gets to me. I'm irritable all the time, and I can't seem to find that humor and patience I used to have. It's like I'm a different person now, and I don't know how to get the old me back.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really missing the person you used to be, the one who could stay calm and make others laugh. What does that "old self" represent for you, in terms of values or qualities that you want to hold onto or get back to?

Patient: I guess the old me was just more... resilient. I valued being able to stay calm under pressure, being the person others could rely on. I always saw myself as the one who could make people laugh, even in tough situations. Those are the qualities I want to hold onto, but it's like I've lost that part of myself since the move. It's frustrating, because I want to be that person again, but right now, I just can't seem to find them.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really missing being that person who can make a difference and bring some levity to tough situations. What do you think is getting in the way of you accessing that resilience and calm right now, especially with everything that's changed in your life since the move?

Patient: I think it's just the sheer amount of change all at once. I went from having a support system, a job I knew like the back of my hand, to being alone in a new city with a whole new set of challenges. I'm feeling overwhelmed, and honestly, a bit lonely too. I just need to figure out how to deal with all this stress, because clearly, taking it out on everyone else isn't the way to go.

Therapist: It sounds like the transition to a new city has been really tough on you, with a lot of unknowns and new challenges. Can you tell me more about what's been the hardest part of adjusting to your new life here, and what's been the most isolating or lonely experience for you so far?

Patient: The hardest part has been not having anyone to fall back on. Back home, I had friends and family to vent to or just hang out with. Now, it's just me. I go to work, come back to an empty apartment, and do it all over again. I've always been an social person, so this isolation has been the biggest change. It's not like I can just go out and make friends instantly, and with my schedule as a nurse, it's not like I have a ton of free time.

Therapist: You mentioned being a social person, and it sounds like the isolation has been really tough for you. What's been the most difficult part of not having that social connection, and are there any places or situations where you've had some brief connections or interactions that you've enjoyed, even if it's just a conversation with a coworker or a neighbor?

Patient: The most difficult part is not having someone to just decompress with, you know? Like after a long day, I used to be able to grab a drink with a friend or just chat with my sibling. Now, it's just me and my thoughts, which isn't always the best thing. As for connections, I guess there's been a few small things. Like, there's a nurse at work, she's been really nice and we've chatted a bit. And the barista at the coffee shop near my apartment is always up for a quick laugh. But it's not the same as having real friends here.

Therapist: It sounds like those small connections at work and with the barista are a good start, but you're still feeling like you're missing out on deeper friendships. What do you think it would take for you to feel like you've established some real friendships here, and what small steps could you take to start building those connections with others?

Patient: I think what's missing is just that history, you know? That comfort level that comes from knowing someone for a long time. I guess to start building that, I could maybe ask the nurse at work if she wants to grab coffee or something. And maybe I could be more open with others too, instead of just keeping to myself. I just don't want to force it, you know? I want it to happen naturally. But maybe I should give it a little nudge.

Therapist: You're right, shared history and comfort can make a big difference in relationships. And it sounds like you're willing to take small steps to build those connections. What do you think would happen if you asked the nurse at work to grab coffee, and it didn't quite click? Would you feel like it was a total failure, or just a minor setback in the process of getting to know her?

Patient: I guess it wouldn't be a total failure. I mean, it might be awkward for a bit, but it's not like I wouldn't see her again. It's just a coffee, not a lifetime commitment, right? I guess I'm just a bit nervous about it, but maybe I'm overthinking it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a bit more comfortable with the idea of taking small steps to build connections. Why don't we make a plan for you to ask the nurse at work to grab coffee, and see where it goes from there?

Patient: Alright, but what if she says no? I mean, I wouldn't be devastated or anything, but it would still sting a bit. I guess I could just play it cool and act like it's no big deal. But maybe she'll say yes, who knows? Okay, let's say I do it tomorrow before my shift starts. That way, if it's awkward, I can just focus on work right after.

Therapist: You're right, it's always possible that she might say no, but it's also possible that she'll say yes. And even if it's just a casual coffee, it's a chance to get to know her better. Let's focus on the process of asking and seeing what happens, rather than the outcome. What do you think you'll say to her when you ask her to grab coffee?

Patient: I guess I'll just keep it casual, like "Hey, I was thinking of grabbing coffee before the shift starts, you wanna join me?" Something like that. I don't want to make it sound like a big deal or anything. Just a casual thing. But what if she thinks it's weird? I mean, we've chatted a bit, but we don't really know each other that well.

Therapist: It sounds like you're thinking about how she might react, but what about how you'll feel if you ask her? What's the worst that could happen, and what's the best?

Patient: I guess the worst that could happen is that I feel a bit embarrassed if she says no. But the best? Well, I guess the best is that we hit it off and I make a new friend. Even if it's not a instant connection, it's at least a step forward, right? I can't expect to make a best friend overnight. Okay, I'll do it. I'll ask her tomorrow.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. You're right, it's not about making a best friend overnight, but about taking small steps towards building connections. So, you've got a plan to ask her tomorrow, and that's a great start. What will you do after you ask her?

Patient: I dunno, play it by ear I guess. If she says yes, then I'll just see where it goes from there. If she says no, then I'll just brush it off and focus on work. No big deal, right? At least I tried, that's something.

Therapist: That's a really great approach. It sounds like you're prioritizing the effort and the learning experience, rather than the specific outcome. Remember, it's not about the result, it's about taking action and moving forward.

Patient: Yeah, that's true. I can't control what she'll say or how she'll react, but I can control whether or not I put myself out there. I just gotta do it and see what happens.

Therapist: That's a really empowering way to think about it. What do you think might happen if you started applying this same approach to other areas of your life, like maybe trying something new or taking a risk in a different context?

Patient: I dunno, I guess it could be good? I mean, it couldn't hurt, right? But it's scary too, you know? Like, what if I fail? What if I make a fool of myself? I guess that's just part of it though, isn't it? Taking risks means maybe not always getting the outcome you want. But maybe it's worth it.

Therapist: That's a really honest and mature way to think about it. You're right, taking risks means there's a chance of not getting the outcome you want, but it's also a chance to learn and grow. What if you were to approach uncertainty as an opportunity for growth, rather than something to be feared?

Patient: Easier said than done, doc. I get what you're saying, and it makes sense, but it's hard to just switch off that fear, you know? I mean, I can try to reframe it as a opportunity for growth, but it's not like that suddenly makes it easy or anything. But yeah, I can try to see it that way.

Therapist: That's completely fair. It's not about switching off fear overnight, it's about taking small steps towards a new way of thinking. And it sounds like you're already taking a big step by acknowledging that it's hard and being willing to try something new.

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. I just need to take it one step at a time. I can't expect to change overnight. But I can try to take small steps. Like asking that nurse out to coffee. That's a start, right?

Therapist: That's exactly right. Taking small steps, like asking the nurse out to coffee, is a great way to start making progress. What's the next small step you can take after that, once you've had a chance to see how it goes?

Patient: I dunno, I guess I could think about maybe joining a club or something? Like a book club or a hiking group? I used to love doing stuff like that back home, maybe it could help me meet more people here. But I don't wanna get ahead of myself, let's see how the coffee thing goes first.

Therapist: That sounds like a great idea! Joining a club or group can be a great way to meet like-minded people. And it's totally fine to take things one step at a time. Why don't you make a mental note to look into some groups that interest you, and see what happens after you've had a chance to get a feel for the coffee thing?

Patient: Yeah, okay. I'll keep it in mind.

Therapist: It was great working with you today. You've made some good progress in thinking about how to take small steps towards building connections and trying new things. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go exactly as planned. You've got a plan in place to ask the nurse out for coffee, and you're thinking about exploring other groups that interest you. That's a great start. Keep taking small steps and see where they lead you.

Patient: Alright, thanks. I'll do my best. See you next time.
