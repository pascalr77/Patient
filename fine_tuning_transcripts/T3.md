Patient: Hi, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been struggling with a lot of anger and frustration. I started a new job, and it's been really demanding. I find myself snapping at my coworkers and even at home. It's not like me, and I'm starting to wonder if I made the wrong decision taking this job, but don’t know what else to do.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, especially with a new job. What does your anger do for you when you snap at your coworkers or even at home?

Patient: I don't know, really. It's like it just boils over, and I can't control it. I think it might be some sort of release, but I honestly don't feel better afterwards. It's more like I'm just left feeling guilty and even more stressed. I just don't know how to handle all the pressure from work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're hoping that snapping at others might somehow relieve the pressure, but it's not actually doing that for you. Can you think of a time recently when you were able to handle the pressure at work without lashing out, and what did you do differently in that situation?

Patient: I'm not sure. I guess there was a time last week when I just walked away and took a few minutes to myself instead of blowing up. I don't know what was different, I just knew I couldn't take it out on anyone else right then. It's not like that made things better, I still felt all that frustration, I didn't scream at anyone though.

Therapist: That's interesting - it sounds like there was a point where you chose not to act on the anger, even if the feeling remained. What was it about not taking it out on anyone else that mattered to you in that moment?

Patient: I guess I just didn't want to make things worse. I knew if I lashed out, I'd feel even more guilty later and the situation would be harder to fix. Plus, I hate seeing that look on people's faces, like they're shocked or hurt. It's not who I want to be, you know?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really motivated by a desire to be a certain kind of person - someone who doesn't hurt others with their anger. Can you tell me more about what that person looks like to you, and what's important about being that kind of person?

Patient: I guess that person is calm, collected, the kind of person people feel safe around. I want to be someone who can handle stress without taking it out on others. It's important to me because I don't want to be known as the hothead, or the person who can't keep it together.

Therapist: It sounds like being that kind of person is really important to you, but it feels like you're struggling to live up to that ideal right now. What does it mean to you to "keep it together" in those moments, and how might you start moving towards being more of that person?

Patient: Honestly, I'm not sure what "keeping it together" even means anymore. I thought I could just push through, but it's not working.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been trying to push through, but that's not working out. What do you think you're trying to achieve by pushing through, and what's at stake if you can't?

Patient: I just want to prove that I can handle this job. If I can't, then I'm right back where I started - unemployed and feeling worthless. I can't fail at this, I just can't. But it's so hard, and I don't know what to do with all this pressure.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of failure is a really strong motivator for you, but it's also causing a lot of distress. What would happen if you allowed yourself to fail at this job, and what might you learn from that experience?

Patient: I don't know what would happen, and that's what scares me. I guess if I failed, I'd have to find something else, something more suited to me maybe. But I don't want to go through that again. I don't want to feel like I've wasted my time and effort. I'm not sure what I'd learn, I just know it would be hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about the unknown, and that's making it hard to move forward. Can you think of a time in your life when you faced uncertainty, and what you learned from it?

Patient: I guess there was a time when I moved to a new city. I didn't know anyone, didn't have a job lined up, it was all pretty uncertain. I learned that I could rely on myself, that I could figure things out even when they were tough. But this feels different, I don't know why.

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to navigate uncertainty in the past and even learned something valuable from it. What is it about this current situation that makes it feel so different, so that you're not able to tap into that same sense of self-reliance?

Patient: I think it's the constant pressure. Before, I could take things at my own pace, figure stuff out as I went. But with this job, it's like I'm constantly under scrutiny, constantly feeling like I have to prove myself. It's exhausting, and it's making me doubt myself in a way I never have before. I don't know how to handle that.

Therapist: It sounds like the constant pressure to prove yourself is really wearing you down and making you doubt yourself in ways you haven't before. Can you imagine what would happen if you were able to set aside the need to constantly prove yourself, and instead focused on what you're actually capable of doing in this job?

Patient: If I could do that, I think I'd be able to think more clearly, maybe even enjoy the work more. But I don't know how to stop feeling like I have to prove myself. It's like it's ingrained in me or something. I can't just turn it off.

Therapist: It sounds like this need to prove yourself feels deeply ingrained, but can you take a step back and consider what might have contributed to this need in the first place? What messages or experiences from your past might be driving this desire to constantly prove yourself?

Patient: I guess growing up, I always felt like I had to live up to certain expectations. My parents, teachers, everyone had these ideas about who I should be, what I should do. I never really felt like I measured up, like I was always falling short. I think that's where it comes from. But knowing that doesn't make it any easier to shake.

Therapist: It sounds like these past experiences have left a lasting impact on you, and it's like you're still trying to prove yourself to others to make up for it. What would it mean to you to let go of the need to prove yourself, to stop trying to measure up to others' expectations, and instead focus on being true to who you are and what you value?

Patient: I don't know if I can just let go of that. It's like, who would I be if I wasn't trying to prove myself? Who am I without that? It's scary to think about, and I wouldn't even know where to start. It's not like I can just flip a switch and be a different person.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that letting go of the need to prove yourself would mean losing a part of who you think you are. But what if you could be multiple things, and being a person who values proving themselves is just one aspect of your identity, not the only one?

Patient: That's a nice thought, but it's hard to see it that way. It feels like if I'm not trying to prove myself, then I'm just... nothing. Like I don't matter. I guess I'm just not sure how to find value in myself without that.

Therapist: It sounds like you're tied to the idea that your worth comes from what you achieve or accomplish, rather than who you are as a person. Can you imagine what it would be like to find value in yourself, not because of what you do, but because of who you are, as a person, with your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences?

Patient: I'm not sure I can. It's hard to even imagine what that would feel like. I mean, I guess it would be nice, but it also feels really vague. How do I actually do that? It's not like I can just tell myself "have value" and it's done.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a clear, practical way to develop this sense of value within yourself. Can you imagine taking a few moments each day to simply notice your thoughts, feelings, and sensations, without judgment, and see if that helps you connect with your own inner experience?

Patient: I can try, but I'm not sure what good it'll do. Isn't that just like, meditating or something? I don't see how that'll help me with my job.

Therapist: It's not about meditation in the classical sense, but more about being present and aware in your daily life, including at work. Can you imagine taking a few deep breaths before a challenging meeting or task, and noticing how that affects your approach and interaction with others?

Patient: Maybe, but I don't know if that'll be enough. I mean, it's not like I can just breathe away all the pressure and stress. It's constant, and it's more than just a meeting or two. But... I guess it couldn't hurt to try.

Therapist: It's not about breathing away the pressure, but about developing a greater sense of awareness and resilience that can help you navigate it. What if, over time, you found that you were able to handle the pressure and stress more effectively, not because you were avoiding it, but because you were better able to stay present and focused in the midst of it?

Patient: That would be great, but it's hard to believe that right now. It feels like I'm barely keeping my head above water. But if I could do that, if I could handle things better, it would make a big difference. I just don't know if I can.

Therapist: It doesn't have to be about being able to handle everything right now, but about taking small steps towards developing that resilience. What if, for the next week, you made a commitment to take just one small step each day to prioritize your well-being, whether that's taking a few deep breaths before a meeting or going for a short walk during your lunch break?

Patient: I guess I could try that. But what if I can't keep it up? What if I forget or something comes up? I don't want to set myself up for failure again.

Therapist: It's natural to worry about failure, but what if you approached it as a natural part of the process, rather than a reflection of your worth? Can you imagine being kind and understanding with yourself if you do forget or miss a day, rather than beating yourself up over it?

Patient: Easier said than done. I'm not great at being kind to myself. But I guess I can try. I just need to remember that this isn't about being perfect, it's about trying to help myself, right?

Therapist: That's exactly right. It's about taking care of yourself, not about being perfect. What does it mean to you to take care of yourself, and how can you start to prioritize that in your life?
