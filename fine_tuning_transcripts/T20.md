Patient: Hey doc, I've been feeling like I'm spinning my wheels lately. Since my breakup, I've been finding it hard to see the point in most things. I wake up, go to work, come home, and that's it. I don't really know what I'm working towards anymore, or what even matters to me.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough place to be. What's one thing you used to do, or a part of your life, that you felt was really meaningful or gave you a sense of purpose before the breakup?

Patient: Before the breakup, I used to love planning weekend hiking trips, being outdoors and all that. But lately, I just haven't felt like doing any of it. It's like I lost my zing.

Therapist: What did that 'zing' feel like, and what did you get from those hiking trips that you're not getting now?

Patient: Zing? I guess it was just excitement, a reason to look forward to the weekend. Being out there, I felt like... free, I guess. It was a chance to clear my head, hang out with friends, and just enjoy the moment without any pressure. Nowadays, it's just work and Netflix. It's like I'm just going through the motions.

Therapist: What would happen if you were to take a short break from Netflix and do something small that gets you outside or moving, just for a few minutes?

Patient: I dunno, doc. I mean, I get what you're saying, but it's not like going for a walk around the block is gonna fix anything. I just... I don't feel like doing much lately. It's kinda pathetic, I know.

Therapist: What's the thought that comes up for you when you say it's "pathetic" that you don't feel like doing much?

Patient: It's like, I should just be able to snap out of it, you know? I should just be able to pull myself up by the bootstraps and get on with it. But I can't, I just feel so unmotivated and that makes me feel so useless.

Therapist: What would happen if you were to let go of the idea that you need to "snap out" of this and just allowed yourself to be where you are right now, without judgment?

Patient: I dunno, that kinda feels like giving up. Like if I do that, then I'm just accepting that I'm gonna feel like this forever. Plus, it's not like I can just turn off the judgments. They're always there, you know? It's hard to ignore them. I want to fix this, to fix me. I just don't know what will actually help.

Therapist: What's the 'me' that you're trying to fix, and what kind of person do you want to be in relation to your current struggles with motivation and self-criticism?

Patient: I just want to be the guy I was before all this. I wanna be someone who can just get on with it and get things done. Someone who doesn't let things get to him. But right now, I just feel so stuck. Like I'm stuck in concrete. I guess I just want to find a way to move forward, to get my life back. And I want to stop beating myself up, but that's easier said than done.

Therapist: What does being someone who "can just get on with it" and isn't easily affected by things mean to you in terms of values or qualities you want to embody?

Patient: I guess it means being strong, resilient. Not letting things get to me, just taking things as they come. Being reliable, someone people can count on. Right now, I just feel so... weak. I wanna be someone who can just pick themselves up and keep going. But also, I want to find something that matters to me beyond just work. I want to find some direction again.

Therapist: What does "something that matters" mean to you in terms of activities, hobbies, or causes? What would you be doing if you were pursuing something that truly engaged you and gave you a sense of direction?

Patient: I dunno, that's the problem. I used to have hiking, and friends, and my ex, and now it's just... nothing. I guess if I had something that mattered, it would be something that got me out of the house, maybe involved other people. Maybe it'd be something physical, something that makes me feel like I've accomplished something. I just don't know what that is anymore. I'm kinda lost, if I'm being honest.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to figure out exactly what you want to do, you were to take small, low-commitment steps towards exploring different activities or groups that might interest you? For example, could you try going for a short walk around the block, or checking out a local meetup group?

Patient: I guess I could do that. I mean, it's not like I have much else going on. But what if I try something and I hate it? Or what if I just can't find anything that interests me? I just don't wanna waste my time, you know?

Therapist: What would be the worst that would happen if you tried something new and didn't like it?

Patient: I guess the worst that would happen is that I'd be out a bit of time and maybe some money. I might feel disappointed, or maybe even a bit stupid for trying. I dunno, I just hate the idea of putting myself out there and then it being a big let down, you know?

Therapist: What do you think you're trying to protect yourself from by avoiding the possibility of disappointment?

Patient: I guess I'm trying to protect myself from feeling like a failure again. I already feel like I've failed at my relationship, and now I'm just failing at life in general. I don't wanna add to that pile, you know? It's like, if I don't try, then I can't fail. But I also can't just keep doing nothing, or I'll just keep feeling stuck. It's kinda messed up, I know.

Therapist: What would happen if you were to reframe your attempts at trying new things as experiments, rather than potential failures?

Patient: Hadn't thought about it like that. So if it doesn't work out, it's not a failure, it's just... data? I guess that would make it less scary. But it's still hard to motivate myself to even start. It's like, even thinking about it is exhausting. I just wanna feel ready, you know? But maybe I'm just making excuses. I don't know.

Therapist: What would you need to feel ready to take the first step towards trying something new?

Patient: I don't know, doc. I guess I just wanna feel like I've got a plan, like I know what I'm doing. But I also know that's not gonna happen unless I, well, unless I start doing something, anything. It's kinda like I'm waiting for a sign, but also scared that if I actually took a step, I might mess it up. It's just... it's hard to explain. I just wanna feel sure, I guess.

Therapist: What if uncertainty wasn't something to be feared, but rather a natural part of the process of finding your way?

Patient: Yeah, maybe. I just hate not knowing, you know? I like having a plan, a direction. But I guess that's kinda the point - I don't have that right now. I just wanna know that I'm not gonna regret whatever I choose to do. But maybe that's not how this works. Maybe I just need to accept that I don't know what's gonna happen, and that's... well, it's not really okay, but it is what it is.

Therapist: What would it be like to take a deep breath and say, "I don't know what's next, but I'm willing to show up and see what happens?"

Patient: It would feel weird. And scary. But also maybe... freeing? It's just hard to imagine actually doing it, you know? I guess I could maybe try it. But it's like, what would I even be showing up for? I don't know what I wanna do, that's the problem.

Therapist: What would you be showing up for if you were simply to be present in this moment, without any expectations or goals?

Patient: I dunno, doc. I guess I'd just be showing up for... me? Just being here, as I am. That feels weird to say. It's like, I'm so used to having a plan or a goal, that just being here feels kinda wrong. But also, maybe it's a bit nice. Just existing, just for a second. I'm not used to that.

Therapist: What would it be like to take a few moments each day to simply notice your breath, your body, and your surroundings, without any agenda or expectation?

Patient: It would be weird, that's for sure. I'm not really the kinda guy who just sits and... notices stuff. But I guess it wouldn't hurt to try. Might be nice to have a break from all the noise in my head. But it's not like it's gonna solve anything, you know? It's not like it's gonna suddenly make me unstuck.

Therapist: What if, instead of waiting for a dramatic shift, you were to focus on making small, incremental changes in your daily life, like taking a few deep breaths each day or paying attention to your surroundings, and see if that can lead to a sense of movement or progress, even if it's slow?

Patient: Yeah, okay, I think I get what you mean, but it kinda feels like you're asking me to run a marathon by taking a bunch of baby steps. I just wanna feel like I'm actually getting somewhere, you know? But I guess maybe that's the whole point - I can't just rush through this. It's just frustrating, feeling like I'm stuck in the slow lane.

Therapist: What if you were to think of it not as taking baby steps, but as moving in small, incremental directions, with each step building on the last, rather than trying to cover a lot of ground all at once?

Patient: Yeah, that makes a bit more sense. It's like, I don't have to see the whole path, I just gotta take a step. I can do that. But it's still kinda scary, you know? Like, what if I take a step and it's the wrong direction? What if I just end up more lost? I just don't wanna mess this up, you know? But I guess if I don't try, I'll just stay stuck. So yeah, okay, I'll try it. Doesn't mean I gotta like it.

Therapist: That's a big step, and I'm proud of you for taking it. What's one small step you can take right now, in this moment, to start moving in the direction you want to go?
