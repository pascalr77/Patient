Patient: Hey, so I've been having a tough time at work lately. I'm a manager, and I can't stop worrying about my performance. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of anxiety and procrastination, which just makes everything worse. I don't know, it's probably not that big of a deal, but it's been on my mind a lot.

Therapist: That worry about your performance at work is weighing on you a lot, isn't it? What's one specific area of your work where you feel like you're not meeting your own expectations, and how does worrying about it affect your daily routine?

Patient: I guess the biggest thing is my team's productivity. I feel like I should be able to get them to do more, you know? But I just don't know how to motivate them. It's not like they're bad employees, I just feel like I'm falling short as a manager. And it's not just at work, it's constant. I'll be sitting at home trying to relax, but I can't stop thinking about it. It's like a loop playing in my head, reminding me that I'm not good enough. It's even started affecting my sleep, which just makes everything harder. But I don't know, maybe I'm just overreacting.

Therapist: That constant loop of self-doubt can be really draining, especially when it's affecting your sleep. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come up when you're trying to relax at home, what specifically is it that makes you feel like you're not good enough as a manager?

Patient: I don't know, it's just this feeling like I should be doing more. Like maybe I'm not communicating well enough, or maybe I'm not delegating right. I start thinking about all the things I could be doing better, and then I start worrying about what my team thinks of me. I mean, they must see that I'm struggling, right? Then I start thinking about what my boss thinks, and before I know it, I'm stuck in this spiral of worry and self-doubt. It's like I can't even enjoy my time off because I'm so caught up in my own head. But I don't know, maybe this is just how it is when you're a manager. Maybe I'm just not cut out for it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like your sense of self-worth is tied up with being a good manager, and that's causing a lot of distress. What's one thing that's most important to you about being a manager, or about yourself in this role, that you feel like you're not meeting or living up to?

Patient: I think the most important thing for me is that I want to be respected. I want my team to look up to me, to trust me, you know? But I don't feel like I'm earning that respect. I feel like I'm just letting everyone down. And it's not just about the results or the productivity, it's about how I feel when I look in the mirror. It's like I'm not living up to my own expectations, and that's what's really eating away at me. But I don't know, maybe that's just selfish. Maybe I should just focus on getting the job done, not on how I feel about it.

Therapist: That desire for respect from your team is a big part of what's driving your self-doubt, isn't it? Can you think of a time when you felt respected by others, not just as a manager, but as a person, and what did that feel like for you?

Patient: Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I want to feel like I deserve it, you know? I don't know, there was this time in college, I was working on a group project, and I just kind of took the lead. Everyone was listening to me, valuing my input. It felt great. I felt confident, like I belonged. But that was back in college, this is the real world. Things are different now. I don't know if I can just flip a switch and be that person again.

Therapist: That college experience sounds like a powerful moment for you. It sounds like you're wondering if you've lost that confidence or sense of self-worth. What would you say to your college self, who felt so confident and respected by their peers, if they were sitting here with us today, feeling uncertain about their abilities as a manager?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'd say, "What happened to you? Where did that confidence go?" But I know that's not fair. Things were different then. I didn't have all this pressure, all this responsibility. I don't know if I can just go back to being that person. I don't know if I even want to. I just want to feel like I'm doing a good job, like I'm worthy of respect. But I don't know how to get there from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking to reconnect with a sense of confidence and worthiness that feels authentic to you. What values or aspects of yourself do you think are getting lost in the midst of all this self-doubt, and how might reclaiming those values help you move forward as a manager?

Patient: I think I've just lost sight of who I am. I used to be creative, you know? I used to be able to think outside the box. And I was kind, I cared about people. But now, I'm just so caught up in my own head, in my own worries. I don't know how to be that person again. I don't know how to be a good manager and still be me. It's like I'm stuck between who I was and who I think I should be. And I don't know which way is forward.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling torn between being a manager and being yourself, and that's causing a lot of tension. Can you think of one small step you could take today, in your role as a manager, that would allow you to express some of your creativity or kindness, even if it's just in a small way?

Patient: I don't know. I mean, I guess I could try to be more present with my team. Maybe ask them how they're doing, not just about work stuff, but genuinely check in with them. I used to do that, but I've been so wrapped up in my own stress that I've lost touch with that. But I don't know, that feels kind of small. I don't see how that's going to help with my performance anxiety.

Therapist: Being present with your team and showing genuine interest in their lives can actually have a ripple effect on your performance anxiety. When you're more connected with your team, you're more likely to trust them, and trust can reduce some of that anxiety. Can you imagine how it might feel to be in a meeting with your team, and instead of worrying about what they think of you, you're actually listening to their ideas and perspectives, and feeling a sense of connection with them?

Patient: I dunno, that just sounds like more pressure. Like I have to be this perfect, attentive listener. I don't know if I have the energy for that right now. And what if they don't want to connect? What if they think I'm just being fake? I don't know, it's not that simple.

Therapist: You're right, it's not about being a perfect listener, it's about being genuine and showing up as yourself. You don't have to be perfect, you just have to be willing to try. And it's okay if your team doesn't respond in the way you want them to, because that's not about you, it's about them. What would happen if you approached this as an experiment, not as a performance, but as a genuine attempt to connect with your team?

Patient: I guess I could try it. But I don't want to feel like I'm failing at something else, you know? I don't want to set myself up for more disappointment. But maybe, maybe I could just try it in a small way. Like maybe I could just start by asking them about their weekends or something. Just something small. I don't know, maybe that would be okay.

Therapist: That sounds like a great place to start - asking about their weekends is a small, low-stakes way to connect with your team. And you're right, it's okay to start small. What if you commit to doing that for just one week, and then see how it goes? Can you imagine how that might feel, to take that small step and see what happens?

Patient: Yeah, I guess I can do that. It's just a small thing, right? I can ask about their weekends, that's not so hard. But what if they don't want to share? What if they think I'm being nosey or something? I don't know, maybe I'm just overthinking this. I'll try it, just for a week. Let's see what happens.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have - you're willing to try something new and see what happens. And that's a good point about people not wanting to share, but what if they do want to share? What if they appreciate the interest and it opens up a connection with them? You'll never know unless you try, and you've already taken the first step by committing to it.

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. I just don't want to get my hopes up, you know? I don't want to be disappointed if it doesn't go well. But I won't know unless I try. Alright, I'll give it a shot. Just for a week. Let's see what happens.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have, being willing to take a risk and see what happens. Remember, it's not about the outcome, it's about the process of taking small steps towards being more of yourself and connecting with your team. Even if it doesn't go as planned, you'll still learn something from it, and that's valuable in and of itself.

Patient: Yeah, okay. I get that. It's about the process, not the outcome. I can try to keep that in mind. But it's still scary, you know? It's still a risk. But I'll try it. I'll ask about their weekends, see where it goes. Just for a week. Let's see what happens.

Therapist: That's a great place to start. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to feel scared. But by taking small risks and being willing to learn from them, you'll build confidence and momentum. What do you think you'll do if this small step goes well, and you feel like you're making progress towards reconnecting with your team and your values?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I'll see how it feels. If it goes well, maybe I'll keep doing it. Maybe I'll try something else too. But I don't want to get ahead of myself. Let's just see how this goes first. I don't want to make any big promises or anything. I just want to take this one step at a time.

Therapist: That's a great way to approach it. Focusing on the present moment and taking things one step at a time can be incredibly empowering. By doing so, you're not putting pressure on yourself to have all the answers or make big changes right away. You're just taking care of yourself and your team, one small step at a time. That's a beautiful way to move forward.

Patient: Yeah, okay. I can try that. I mean, it's not like I have to fix everything at once, right? I can just do one thing, see how it goes. Maybe that's enough for now. I don't know, we'll see.

Therapist: Exactly, you don't have to fix everything at once. Just taking one small step can be enough. And it's not just about fixing things, it's about being willing to move forward, even if it's just a tiny bit. That's a huge step in and of itself. Let's just see where this journey takes you, one small step at a time.

Patient: Alright, yeah. One small step. I can do that. Let's see where it goes.

Therapist: I think we've made some great progress here today. Remember, this is just the start of a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to not have all the answers. You've taken a big step forward by being willing to try something new, and that's something to be proud of. Let's just see where this journey takes you, one small step at a time.

Patient: Okay. One step. I get it. We'll see.

Therapist: I'm glad we've been able to have this conversation. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You've got this. Take care of yourself and your team, and see where this journey takes you.

Patient: Thanks. I'll try. Have a good one.

Therapist: You're welcome. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next time.

Patient: Yeah, see you.

Therapist: Bye.

Patient: Bye

Therapist: The session has ended.
