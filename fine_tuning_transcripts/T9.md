Patient: Hey, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. Lately, I've been really stuck in my own head about work. I've been worrying non-stop about my performance as a teacher, and it's led to this awful cycle of procrastination that I can't seem to break. It's like I'm constantly second-guessing myself, and it's exhausting. I hope talking to you can help me find a way out of this.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. When you say you're constantly second-guessing yourself, can you describe a recent situation at work where this self-doubt showed up, and what thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

Patient: Sure, just the other day I was supposed to submit lesson plans for the upcoming week, but I found myself stuck on the simplest parts. I kept thinking, "What if this isn't good enough?" or "What if the other teachers think this is stupid?". It was like I was frozen, and I just couldn't get the work done on time. I ended up rushing through it at the last minute, which only made the anxiety worse. It's just a never-ending loop.

Therapist: It sounds like this self-doubt is really effective at making you feel like you're stuck and unable to move forward. Can you tell me what you think this self-doubt is trying to protect you from? What might happen if you don't have the perfect lesson plans?

Patient: Honestly, I'm not sure what it's protecting me from. I guess maybe it's trying to keep me from failing? Like, if I don't have the perfect lesson plans, maybe the students won't learn anything, or maybe my colleagues will think I'm incompetent. But even as I say that, I know it sounds a bit irrational. It's just hard to shake the feeling, you know?

Therapist: It does sound like there's a bit of a disconnect between what's going on in your thoughts and what you know is rational. As a teacher, what matters most to you about your work? What kind of impact or outcome are you hoping to have on your students?

Patient: I think what matters most to me is that my students genuinely understand and absorb what they're learning. I want to inspire a love for the subject, not just have them memorize facts for a test. I hope that my teaching can make a real difference in their lives, even if it's just in a small way. But lately, it feels like all I'm doing is trying to keep my head above water, rather than actually making an impact. It's frustrating.

Therapist: That's a beautiful vision for your teaching. When you're in the midst of feeling overwhelmed and stuck, as you were with the lesson plans, what would it take for you to take a step towards acting on that value, even if it's just a small step?

Patient: I wish I knew. It's like there's this thick wall between me and even the smallest steps forward. Maybe just starting with one thing – like focusing on one interesting fact or story to share with the students, instead of trying to perfect the entire lesson plan? But it's hard to keep that in mind when the anxiety kicks in. It's like I need a reminder or something.

Therapist: It sounds like anxiety is creating a bit of a barrier for you. What do you think anxiety is trying to keep you safe from in this situation?

Patient: Keep me safe from failing, I guess. From the looks on the students' faces if I don't have all the answers, or from the judgment of the other teachers if my lessons aren't good enough. It's like anxiety is trying to protect me from any possible criticism or disappointment. But it's actually making things worse.

Therapist: Can you imagine, for a moment, that you're not trying to avoid criticism or disappointment, but instead, you're allowing yourself to experience it as it comes. Not because you want to suffer, but because you're curious about what it's like to be in this situation without the weight of anxiety. What would that be like for you?

Patient: I'm not sure I can imagine that. I mean, I know it's something I should work towards, but right now, it just feels like I'd be naked without the anxiety. Like, who would I be if I wasn't worried about all this stuff? It's scary to think about, to be honest.

Therapist: That feeling of being naked without the anxiety is a really interesting one. When you say "who would I be if I wasn't worried about all this stuff," what do you think that person would be like? What values or qualities would they embody as a teacher?

Patient: I think that person would be more present with the students, more patient. They'd be creative and enthusiastic about teaching, not bogged down by constant worry. That person would remember why they became a teacher in the first place – to inspire and make a difference. But it's hard to even imagine that right now. It feels like I'm so far from that person.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a big gap between who you are now and who you'd like to be as a teacher. Can you take a deep breath and notice what's happening in your body right now? What's it like to simply be in this moment, with your students, in this classroom, without trying to achieve anything or avoid anything?

Patient: It's tough. I feel a bit tense, to be honest. My shoulders are tight, and there's a bit of a knot in my stomach. But there's also a part of me that feels a little curious, like maybe there's a way to just be here without all the usual stress. It's not easy, but it's interesting to notice.

Therapist: That curiosity you mentioned, it's like a small seed that's been planted. Can you tend to it for a moment? What would it take for you to nurture this curiosity, to see where it might lead you in this moment, with your students, in this classroom?

Patient: I think it would take some patience with myself, for starters. Maybe also a willingness to let go of the idea that everything has to be perfect right away. I could try focusing on just one thing at a time, like really listening to what a student is saying, rather than getting caught up in all the things I think I should be doing. But it feels strange, like I'm going against my instincts.

Therapist: It sounds like you're not just talking about a new approach to teaching, but also a new way of being with yourself. Can you imagine that you're already taking these small steps, and you're doing them with kindness and curiosity? What would that feel like for you, to be able to approach your teaching in this way, even if it feels strange at first?

Patient: It feels both scary and a little exciting. I'm used to being so hard on myself, so this gentler approach feels foreign, but also kind of nice, like maybe I'd be able to breathe more easily. But I'm not sure how to actually make that happen. I need more than just imagining it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck between the idea of being gentler with yourself and the actual doing of it. What's one small, tangible thing you can do right now, in this moment, to take a step towards being kinder to yourself, even if it's just for a few seconds?

Patient: I guess I could take a few slow, deep breaths. That feels manageable. It's not like it'll fix everything, but maybe it's a start, at least for this moment. I do feel like I need to do something.

Therapist: Taking a few deep breaths can be a powerful way to bring yourself back to the present moment. Can you commit to taking those deep breaths right now, and as you do, allow yourself to say to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"?

Patient: Okay, I'm taking those breaths. It feels a bit weird to say that to myself, but I'll try it. I'm doing the best I can, and that's... enough. I don't really believe it yet, but I said it.

Therapist: It's okay if you don't fully believe it yet. Repeating it was the first step. Now, can you see if you can allow yourself to feel into the phrase, even if it's just a tiny bit? What does it feel like in your body when you say it, even if your mind doesn't fully agree?

Patient: It feels a bit strange, really. There's a tiny bit of relief, maybe? Like a small weight lifted off my chest. But it's also kind of uncomfortable. It's like I'm not used to giving myself that kind of permission. It feels awkward, to be honest.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're navigating uncharted territory, and that's okay. This permission you're giving yourself, it's not just about feeling better, but also about getting used to a new way of being with yourself. Can you allow yourself to feel into this awkwardness, to explore it a bit, and see if you can find any curiosity or interest in this new experience?

Patient: It's hard to feel curious when I'm feeling so uncomfortable. But maybe there's a little bit of interest in seeing where this goes. I just have no idea what that looks like or how to make it happen. I guess I'm willing to try, but it feels a bit clumsy.

Therapist: It's okay to feel clumsy when you're trying something new. Can you take that willingness to try and combine it with the phrase "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"? See if you can say it again, but this time with a sense of curiosity, like you're experimenting with this new way of being.

Patient: I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough. Okay, saying it like that felt a bit different. Still weird, but maybe a bit more doable. I don't know if it's really making a difference yet, but I guess it's worth trying again.

Therapist: That's a great start. Now, let's see if we can take it a bit further. Can you imagine that you're a student in your own classroom, and you're struggling with a lesson plan, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain. What would you say to that student, if you were trying to be kind and supportive?

Patient: I'd probably say something like, "It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Let's take this one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right away. I'm here to support you and I have no doubt that you're doing the best you can, and that's what's important."

Therapist: That's a wonderful message. Can you take a moment to receive it from yourself, as if you're that student? Can you say those words back to yourself, "It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Let's take this one step at a time. I'm here to support you and I have no doubt that you're doing the best you can, and that's what's important"?

Patient: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Let's take this one step at a time. This feels really silly, but okay. I'm here to support... myself. I have no doubt that I'm doing the best I can. I don't know if I really believe that last part, but I guess I can try to act like I do.

Therapist: That's a great start. Remember, you don't have to believe it fully to act on it. You can start by acting as if you believe it, and see what happens. Can you take a moment to notice how it feels to support yourself in this way, even if it's just a small step?

Patient: It feels a bit forced, but also kind of comforting, like wrapping myself in a blanket. It's not going to solve everything, but it's a little nicer than beating myself up. I guess that's something. I just don't want to feel like I'm fooling myself, you know?

Therapist: It's not about fooling yourself, but about being kind to yourself in a way that feels true to who you are. Can you see that beating yourself up is not a kind or authentic way of treating yourself either? Maybe you're not choosing between authenticity and self-compassion, but rather, you're choosing between two different forms of self-treatment.

Patient: Yeah, I see your point. It's just hard to find that middle ground sometimes. I don't want to make excuses for myself, but I also don't want to be overly harsh. It's a weird balance to try and find. I'm not sure I know how to do that.

Therapist: It's not about finding a specific balance, but about being willing to adjust your approach as you navigate different situations. Can you see that being kind to yourself doesn't mean making excuses, but rather, it means being understanding and supportive, even when you make mistakes?
