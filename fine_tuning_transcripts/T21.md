# Transcript T21

Patient: Hey doc, lately I've been struggling with my temper. Ever since the kids moved out, it's like I've got all this pent-up frustration. Little things set me off, and I can't seem to control it. It's causing problems at work and at home. I just don't know what to do with all this anger.

Therapist: You're saying that little things are setting you off, and it's affecting both your work and home life. What's one specific thing that happened recently that made you feel really angry, and what happened right before that?

Patient: I got into it with my wife the other day. She moved some of my stuff while cleaning and I just lost it. It was right after I got home from work, I was already on edge from the traffic.

Therapist: It sounds like being stuck in traffic was already a tough start to the day, and then coming home to that argument with your wife really set you off. When you're driving and feeling frustrated with the traffic, what's going through your mind, and what does that feeling of frustration do for you in that moment?

Patient: I don't know, doc. I just get so mad. It's like everyone is in my way, like they're all driving just to piss me off. I get so tense, gripping the wheel, heart racing. It's like I'm ready to explode. I guess it's like I'm ready for a fight, you know?

Therapist: You feel like you're ready to explode and ready for a fight, which suggests that there's something inside you that's pushing for action. What do you think you'd be fighting for in those moments - what's the underlying goal or value that's being threatened or not met?

Patient: I don't know, really. I guess maybe... maybe it's like I want to be in control, you know? Like I want things to be orderly, to make sense. And when they don't, like with the traffic or my stuff being moved, it's like I'm under attack. Like my whole world is off-kilter. It's hard, doc, I’m trying to hold it together, but nothing seems to help.

Therapist: It sounds like feeling out of control and disoriented is really challenging for you, and it's affecting your interactions with others, like with your wife. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're losing control - do you lash out, withdraw, or try to micromanage situations?

Patient: Yeah, I lash out. I yell, sometimes throw stuff. I don't want to, doc. I just can't help it. It's like everything builds up and I just explode. I don’t want to withdraw—I want things to be right, to be in order. But when they're not, I can't handle it. It's like I'm drowning.

Therapist: It sounds like your outbursts are a way of trying to regain control in a situation that feels overwhelming. What do you think you're trying to achieve with those outbursts - are you trying to scare someone into doing what you want, or is there something else at play?

Patient: I don't know, doc. I guess maybe I just want things to be how I need them to be. Like, if I yell or throw something, maybe people will see how serious I am and just do what I want. But it doesn't really work, does it? It just makes things worse. I don't know what else to do.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a strong sense of what you stand for and how you want things to be, and that's driving your behavior, even if it's not working out. Can you tell me more about what's most important to you - what are your core values, and how do you think you can live those values in a way that doesn't involve exploding or lashing out?

Patient: I just want things to be right, doc. Orderly. Predictable. I can't stand chaos, you know? It's like each thing has its place and when it's not in that place... it's just wrong. I don’t know how to live that way without losing it. I guess maybe... maybe I just need to find a way to make things right again. But how do I do that without blowing up? It's hard, doc. It's really hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really clear about what's important to you, and that's a great starting point. Can you imagine a day or a situation where you're living in a way that honors those values of order and predictability, but without the explosions or chaos - what would that look like?

Patient: Maybe... maybe I'd just be calm, you know? I'd wake up, everything in its place. I'd go to work, no surprises, no chaos. I'd come home, everything just as I left it. I wouldn't yell, wouldn't throw stuff. I'd just... be at peace. But that seems impossible, doc. It's like I'm always on edge, always waiting for something to go wrong. I can't imagine it any other way.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really clear about what you want, but it feels like there's a big gap between that and your current experience. What do you think would need to change or be different for you to start living more in line with the calm, peaceful vision you just described?

Patient: I don't know, doc. I guess maybe if people just did what they're supposed to do, you know? If they'd just put things back where they belong, drive the way they're supposed to. But I can't control other people. I guess maybe... maybe I just need to find a way to control myself, you know? To not let it all get to me. But that's hard, doc. It's really hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see that you can't control everything and everyone, but you can control how you respond to things. That's a really important insight. What do you think it would take for you to start taking more responsibility for your own reactions and responses, rather than trying to control others or the world around you?

Patient: I don't know, doc. It's not like I want to be this way, you know? I just... I just don't know how to do things differently. I guess maybe I need to learn how to pause, you know? To think before I act. But it's hard. It's like I'm on autopilot sometimes. I don’t know how to change that.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that you need to develop some new habits and skills to help you respond more thoughtfully. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a few seconds of space between feeling angry or frustrated and acting on it - what would that feel like, and what could you do in that space?

Patient: I don't know, doc. I guess maybe it would feel... calm? Like a moment of peace, you know? But it's hard to imagine. It's like my anger is this huge wave, and I'm just caught in it. But maybe... maybe if I could just pause, take a breath... maybe I could count to ten or something. Maybe I could ask myself, "Is this worth getting mad over?" But it's hard, doc. It's really hard to imagine doing things differently.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to get a sense of what it might be like to pause and respond more thoughtfully, rather than just reacting impulsively. Let's try a little experiment: take a deep breath with me, and as we exhale, say to yourself, "I can pause, I can choose how I respond." Can you do that with me?

Patient: Okay, doc. I can try. *inhales* *exhales* "I can pause, I can choose how I respond." It feels weird, but... but it's kinda nice too. Like a moment of control, you know? But it's hard, doc. It's really hard to imagine doing this when I'm really mad.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of control and clarity in this moment, but you're worried that it won't translate to when you're really angry. Can you imagine a specific situation where you feel yourself getting angry, and then take a moment to pause and remind yourself, "I can pause, I can choose how I respond"? What does that look like, and what would you do in that moment?

Patient: I guess maybe... maybe I'm driving, right? And someone cuts me off. I can feel my grip tightening on the wheel, my heart racing. But maybe... maybe I take a deep breath, say to myself, "I can pause, I can choose how I respond." Maybe I count to ten. Maybe I tell myself, "It's not worth it. Just let it go." But it's hard, doc. It's really hard to imagine doing this in the moment. What if I can't? What then?

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel uncertain or worried about not being able to do this, especially in the heat of the moment. But what if you did make a mistake, or didn't pause when you wanted to? What would you do then? Would you be kind to yourself, or would you beat yourself up over it?

Patient: I don't know, doc. I guess maybe... maybe I'd be pretty hard on myself. I'd probably think, "You idiot, you can't even do this right. You're never going to change." I don't know if I could be kind to myself, doc. It's not really something I'm good at, you know? But I guess... I guess maybe I could try. Maybe I could say, "It's okay, just try again next time." But it's hard, doc. It's really hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to get a sense of what it might be like to be kind to yourself, even when you make mistakes. Can you try it right now, in this moment, with me? Say to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough."

Patient: I don't know, doc. It feels weird. But... but okay. "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough." It's hard to believe, doc. It's really hard. But maybe... maybe it could be true. Maybe I could be enough, just as I am.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see that you can be enough, just as you are, without needing to be perfect or in control all the time. Can you take that sense of self-acceptance with you, not just in our sessions, but into your daily life, and see what happens when you approach challenges with a sense of "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"?

Patient: I don't know, doc. It's gonna be hard, you know? But... but maybe I can try. Maybe I can just take it one day at a time, one moment at a time. Maybe I can remind myself that I'm doing the best I can, even when it's tough. But it's scary, doc. It's really scary. What if I fail? What then?

Therapist: It's okay to be scared, and it's okay to not know what the future holds. But what if, instead of focusing on the fear of failure, you focus on the possibility of growth and learning? What if you see each moment as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than a chance to fail?

Patient: Okay, doc. I hear you. It's just... it's just hard to see it that way, you know? But maybe... maybe I can try. Maybe I can just focus on one moment at a time, try to learn from it. But it's tough, doc. It's really tough to change the way I think like this. But I guess... I guess maybe it's worth a shot. I just don’t want to keep living like this, you know?

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to take a step towards creating a different life for yourself. That takes a lot of courage. I'm proud of you for being willing to try something new. What's one small step you can take in the next 24 hours to start moving towards the kind of life you want to live?

Patient: I don't know, doc. This is all so new. But maybe... maybe I can just try that thing we did earlier. The breathing thing, you know? Maybe I can just try that once tomorrow, when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Just try it once, and see what happens. But I'm not making any promises, doc. I'm not sure I can do this.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Trying the breathing exercise once tomorrow when you're feeling overwhelmed is a small but significant step. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about being willing to try something new and see what happens. I'll see you next week, and we can check in on how it went.

Patient: Alright, doc. I'll try. But like I said, no promises. I'll see you next week.

Therapist: Sounds good, I'll see you next week then. Remember, I'm not expecting you to be perfect, and I'm not expecting you to have all the answers. Just show up, be willing to try, and we'll work together to figure things out. Take care of yourself until then.

Patient: Okay, doc. I'll try. See you next week.

Therapist: Sounds good, I'll see you next week. Take care of yourself until then.
