# Transcript T25

Patient: I've been feeling a bit off lately. Since losing my spouse, I've found myself getting more irritated and frustrated, especially when people try to talk to me about it. It's like I can't control my anger, and it's not like me. I just feel so... overwhelmed.

Therapist: That feeling of not being in control of your anger and feeling overwhelmed sounds really tough. When you say you feel like you're not like yourself, what does that specifically mean to you - what behaviors or parts of your personality do you feel are missing or changing since your spouse passed away?

Patient: I mean that I used to be so patient, you know? I never used to raise my voice or get snappy with people. But now, every time someone brings up my spouse or asks how I'm doing, I find myself getting so irritated. I've even started avoiding friends and family just to dodge these conversations. It's like I'm pushing people away, and I don't want to be that kind of person.

Therapist: You feel like you're losing sight of who you are and how you want to be in the world. When you think about being patient and kind, what does that mean to you in terms of how you want to show up in relationships with others right now?

Patient: It means I want to be more understanding, like I used to be. I want to be able to talk to people without this constant irritation. I want to be the kind of person others can rely on, even when it's tough. I just want to find a way to manage this anger so I can be present for my loved ones, you know? But it's so hard when I feel like everyone is prying.

Therapist: You want to be the kind of person others can rely on, even when it's tough. But when people ask about your spouse, it feels like they're prying into something you're not ready to share. What do you think would happen if you were to open up to someone about your grief, and what would that do for you in terms of being present for others?

Patient: I'm not sure. I think I'm afraid that if I start talking about it, I might break down. I don't want to burden anyone with my feelings. But at the same time, I think if I could just get past this initial hurdle, it might help me process everything. Maybe it would help me be more present, like you said. It's just... it's so hard to even think about it, let alone talk about it.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a part of you that's really hesitant to open up about your feelings, and that's creating a big obstacle. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the emotions that come up when you think about sharing your grief with someone - what would you be protecting yourself from, and what would that protection do for you in the short-term?

Patient: I think I'm protecting myself from feeling too vulnerable. If I let myself feel those emotions, I'm afraid I'll just break down. In the short term, pushing them away helps me feel more in control, like I can keep it together. But I know it's not healthy long term. I just don't know how to bridge that gap.

Therapist: You mention feeling in control when you push your emotions away, but what does "keeping it together" mean to you in this context - is it about not showing emotions, or is it about feeling like you're managing your life effectively, even if it's at the cost of your emotional well-being?

Patient: It's more about not showing emotions. I don't want people to see me like that, all broken. I want to appear like I'm handling things, even if I'm not. It's like I'm trying to convince myself and everyone else that I'm okay, even when I'm not. But I know it's not really working.

Therapist: You're recognizing that trying to appear okay when you're not is a way to convince yourself and others, but it's also causing you distress. What would it mean for you to be okay with not being okay, with showing your vulnerability and imperfections, and still be valued and respected by others?

Patient: I'm not really sure. I guess I'm afraid that if I show my vulnerability, people will see me as weak. But at the same time, I want to be genuine and authentic. I can't always be the strong one, but what if people get tired of my grief? I don’t want to be a burden. It's all so confusing.

Therapist: You're worried that if you show your vulnerability, people will see you as weak, but what if that's not the only story that's possible - what if people could see your vulnerability as a sign of strength and courage, and that it's okay to need support and connection from others?

Patient: That's a hard one. I never really thought of it that way. Maybe they wouldn't see me as weak, but it's still scary. I guess if they saw it as strength, it would make it easier to open up. But I still don't know how to start. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of fear and avoidance. How do I change that?

Therapist: You're feeling stuck in this cycle of fear and avoidance, but you want to break free. What's one small thing you could do today, or this week, that would move you in the direction of being more authentic and open with someone you trust - it might be a phone call, a text, or a conversation with a friend, but it's a tiny step that feels manageable to you.

Patient: Maybe I could start by just telling one person that I'm having a tough time. Nothing too detailed or heavy, just a text to a close friend saying I'm struggling. I don't have to dive into the grief talk yet. That feels a bit more manageable, I think. Baby steps, right?

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan - telling one person you're struggling is a huge step, and it's not about diving into the details right now, just about acknowledging that you're not okay. What do you think will happen if you send that text, and what will you do if your friend responds with support and understanding?

Patient: I think I might feel a bit relieved, actually. Just saying it out loud to someone might lift some weight off my shoulders. If they respond with support, I think I'll probably feel a bit tearful but also comforted. Maybe I'll just take it from there, see how it feels. I don't have to have all the answers right away, do I?

Therapist: You're right, you don't have to have all the answers right away, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Can you take a deep breath and imagine sending that text to your friend, and then see what happens next, without trying to control the outcome or predict what will happen?

Patient: Okay, I'm imagining it. I send the text, "Hey, I'm having a tough time lately. Just wanted to let you know." I put down my phone. I wait.

Therapist: What do you notice in this moment, as you wait for a response? What are your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations like right now?

Patient: I notice my heart is beating a bit faster. I feel a bit anxious, but also a little hopeful. My thoughts are racing, wondering what they'll say, if they'll understand. I keep checking my phone, feeling a bit jittery. It's weird, but it also feels good to have finally said something, even if it's just a small thing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of uncertainty, but also a sense of hope and relief. Can you stay with these feelings for a moment, and see if you can allow yourself to feel them fully, without trying to push them away or analyze them too much?

Patient: That's really hard. I want to just distract myself, but I'll try. Okay, I'm feeling it. It's scary, but there's a warmth too. Like I'm doing the right thing. It's still really uncomfortable. I don't know how long I can stay with it.

Therapist: It's okay that it's uncomfortable - in fact, it's a sign that you're being brave and taking a risk. Can you see if you can allow yourself to lean into this sense of warmth and rightness, and see if it can give you some guidance or direction for what to do next?

Patient: Leaning into it... It's like the warmth is telling me I should do more of this. Maybe I should try to talk to someone else too. Not about all the details, just that I'm having a hard time. Maybe it could be okay. But I'm still not sure. It's all so new.

Therapist: You're not sure, but you're willing to explore and take small steps. That's a great place to be. What if you were to take another small step, like talking to someone else about how you're feeling, and see what happens? What would be one thing you could say to them, and what might you hope to get from the conversation?

Patient: I guess I could say something like, "I've been feeling a bit off lately. Just wanted you to know." Maybe I hope they'll just listen and understand. Maybe they've felt like this too. I don't know. I just want to feel less alone, I guess. But what if they ask about the details? I'm not ready to talk about that yet.

Therapist: You're not ready to talk about the details, and that's okay. You can say as much or as little as you want. Can you see that setting boundaries and saying "I'm not ready to talk about that yet" is actually a way of taking care of yourself and your own needs, rather than a sign of weakness?

Patient: Maybe. It's just hard to think of it that way. I don't want to disappoint anyone or make them feel like I'm pushing them away. But I guess if they really care about me, they'll understand. Right? It's just... it's so hard to believe that sometimes.

Therapist: You're worried about disappointing others, but what if you could see that your worth and value come from within, and that others' understanding and acceptance are not dependent on you being vulnerable? What if you could trust that you're worthy of connection and love, no matter what?

Patient: I wish I could see that. It's just so hard to believe. I want to, though. I want to feel like I'm enough, like I deserve love and connection even when I'm struggling. I just don't know how to get there. I guess that's why I'm here, right? To figure that out?

Therapist: You're here to figure out how to cultivate a sense of self-worth and deservingness, and that's a brave and important journey. What if you were to approach yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you would offer to a good friend in a similar situation? How might you talk to yourself, and what might you say to yourself, in those moments when you're struggling?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'd say something like, "It's okay to struggle. You're doing the best you can. It's okay to not have all the answers." But it's so much easier to say that to someone else than to myself. Why is that? It's like I have this constant critic in my head.

Therapist: You mentioned that it's easier to be kind to a friend than to yourself, and that you have a critical inner voice. Can you try to imagine where this voice might be coming from, and what it might be trying to protect you from? What if this voice is not a enemy, but a part of you that's trying to help you, even if it's doing it in a harsh way?

Patient: Maybe it's trying to protect me from failure. Like if I'm critical enough, I won't make mistakes. But it's just making me feel worse. I never thought of it as trying to help, but maybe it is. It's just going about it all wrong. Is there a way to make it more helpful?

Therapist: What if you were to imagine that your critical voice is a part of you that's trying to help you avoid pain, but is using the wrong method. What if you could reframe it as a more supportive voice, like a coach or a mentor, that's trying to help you learn and grow from your mistakes? How might that voice sound, and what would it say to you in those moments when you're struggling?

Patient: Maybe it would say something like, "It's okay to make mistakes. You're learning. You're growing. You don't have to be perfect to be worthy." That feels better. It's still hard to believe, but it feels more supportive. I like the idea of a coach. Someone who sees my potential and wants to help me grow. But it's so different from what I'm used to.

Therapist: You're starting to imagine a more supportive inner voice, and it feels more believable and helpful. Can you take it a step further and imagine what it would be like to have this coach-like voice present with you in everyday moments, like when you're making decisions or facing challenges? What would it say to you, and how would it help you?
