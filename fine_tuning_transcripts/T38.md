# Transcript T38

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really struggling with social anxiety. It's got me avoiding gatherings with friends, even those I've known for years. It's been pretty tough, especially with the house being empty now. I just feel like I'm stuck in my own head sometimes.

Therapist: That feeling of being stuck in your head can be really isolating. Can you tell me more about what being "stuck in your head" feels like for you? What's happening when you're in that state?

Patient: It's like I'm trapped in a cycle of overthinking. I start focusing on what others might be thinking about me, if they're judging me, or if I'll say something stupid. It's exhausting, and it's easier to just avoid situations that trigger it. But then, I feel lonely and stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like this cycle of overthinking is really draining for you. What do you think you're trying to achieve or protect by getting caught up in these thoughts about what others might think?

Patient: I guess I'm trying to protect myself from embarrassment or rejection. I want to be liked and accepted, and I don't want to give anyone a reason to think badly of me. But I also know that by avoiding these situations, I'm not giving anyone the chance to accept me either. It's just... tough.

Therapist: It sounds like being liked and accepted by others is really important to you. When you imagine yourself being liked and accepted by others, what kind of person are you being in those situations? What qualities or actions are you showing in that scenario?

Patient: I imagine I am being open and friendly, showing interest in others, and making conversation easily. I am confident and approachable in those moments. It's like I'm not overthinking anymore, and I can just be myself and connect with people effortlessly. I laugh, I engage, and I'm not constantly worried about what they think of me. But getting to that point feels impossible right now.

Therapist: That sounds like a really beautiful vision of yourself. What do you think is the biggest difference between the way you are in those moments of feeling open and confident, and the way you are when you're caught up in overthinking and anxiety?

Patient: The biggest difference is that when I'm open and confident, I'm not focused on myself. I'm genuinely interested in others and the conversation flows naturally. But when I'm anxious, it's like I'm trapped in my own thoughts, constantly monitoring and judging myself. I become too self-aware, and it's paralyzing. It's hard to break out of that.

Therapist: It sounds like when you're anxious, your self-awareness is becoming a bit of a burden. Let's try to approach this in a different way: can you imagine that your thoughts and feelings are just passing events, like clouds in the sky, rather than a reflection of who you are as a person?

Patient: That's an interesting thought, but it's hard to imagine. When I'm in that moment, the thoughts feel so real and all-consuming. I know logically that they're just thoughts, but it's like I can't separate myself from them. It's something I need to work on, I suppose.

Therapist: That makes sense that it feels like you can't separate yourself from your thoughts in those moments. Can you allow yourself to acknowledge that it's okay to feel like you're your thoughts, even if it's not the whole truth? Can you accept that this is just how it feels right now, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I can try. It's just really frustrating, you know? I want to be able to control it, to just silence that voice in my head. But maybe accepting that it's there is a start. I just don't want to feel like this forever.

Therapist: That's a great start, acknowledging that acceptance might be a way forward. When you imagine yourself being able to connect with others and be open and friendly, like you mentioned earlier, what small step could you take today, right now, to move closer to that vision, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Maybe I could send a message to a friend I haven't talked to in a while. Just a simple "Hello, how have you been?" kind of thing. I don't have to dive right into a big social gathering, but maybe taking small steps to reconnect would help. I just... it's scary, but maybe I can do just that.

Therapist: That's a great idea, sending a message to a friend. It's a small, manageable step that can help you build connection and confidence. Can you take a deep breath, and right now, send that message? Just do it, without thinking too much about the outcome.

Patient: Okay, I did it. I sent a message to an old friend just saying hi and asking how they've been. I feel a bit nervous now, but also a little proud that I did it. Let's see how it goes. It's a start, I guess.

Therapist: That's a great start, and it's amazing that you took that step. It sounds like you're already practicing self-care by taking small steps towards connection and openness. What would you say is the most important thing you're taking care of for yourself right now, by taking this action?

Patient: I think I'm taking care of my need for connection. I've been feeling so isolated and lonely, and even though it's scary, reaching out like this reminds me that I have people who care about me. It's like I'm tending to a part of me that's been neglected.

Therapist: That's beautiful. It sounds like you're recognizing that your need for connection is a fundamental part of who you are, and that tending to it is a vital act of self-care. Can you allow yourself to feel a sense of appreciation and kindness towards yourself for taking this step, not just because it might lead to something else, but because it's an act of self-love and care in and of itself?

Patient: That's easier said than done. I still feel a bit anxious, like I want to retreat again. But yeah, I guess I can try to appreciate that I took a small step forward. It's just hard to feel proud of myself for something that seems so small. But it is something, I suppose.

Therapist: It's okay to feel anxious, and it's also okay to acknowledge that taking a small step forward is something to be proud of, even if it feels small. Can you try to see that this small step is a sign that you're capable of growth and change, and that you're taking care of yourself in a way that's meaningful to you?

Patient: I'm trying to see it that way. It's just hard when the anxiety is still there, you know? But I do want to grow and change. I don't want to be stuck like this forever. So maybe this is a start, even if it's a small one.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. It sounds like you're taking a step towards a larger vision of yourself, even if it's just a small one. What is it about living a life that's free from anxiety and feeling stuck that matters most to you? What kind of person do you want to be, and what kind of life do you want to lead?

Patient: I want to be someone who's open and present with others. I want to lead a life where I don't feel held back by fear, where I can enjoy moments without overthinking. I want to be able to connect with people, go out, have fun without this constant anxiety. I just want to feel free, I guess. Like I'm not a prisoner to my own thoughts.

Therapist: That's a beautiful vision, and it's something you can start living into right now, not just someday in the future. Can you take a deep breath and imagine yourself being that person, living that life, right here and now? What would that feel like, and what would you be doing in this moment, if you were already living that way?

Patient: If I were living that way right now, I think I'd feel lighter, more at ease. I'd be engaged in the moment, not stuck in my head. Maybe I'd be reaching out to more friends, or even planning a get-together. It's hard to imagine, but it sounds really nice.

Therapist: That sounds wonderful. It's great that you can imagine yourself feeling that way. Can you take another deep breath and see if you can bring some of that sense of ease and engagement into this moment, right here? What would you need to do, or let go of, in this moment to feel a bit more like that person you're imagining?

Patient: I think I'd need to let go of the idea that I need to have everything figured out right now. I'm always so focused on the future and what might happen, that I forget to just be here. So maybe, just for this moment, I can try to relax and not worry so much about what comes next. That would be a start, at least.

Therapist: That's a great insight. It sounds like you're recognizing that you don't have to have all the answers right now, and that the present moment has value in and of itself. Can you take a deep breath and see if you can allow yourself to be here, in this moment, without needing to know what's coming next?

Patient: I'm trying. It's not easy, but I'm here, I'm present. I'm not sure what that means for the future, but I'm doing my best to just be in the now. It feels strange, but also a bit relieving.

Therapist: That's a great start. Being present in the moment can be a strange and unfamiliar feeling at first, but it's also a beautiful way to experience life. Can you allow yourself to notice the sensation of being present, without judgment or expectation, and just see what it's like to be here, right now?

Patient: I'm noticing that my body feels a bit tense, but my mind is quieter. It's like there's a sense of possibility, but also some fear. It's hard to just be here without thinking about what's next. But I'm trying.

Therapist: That's a great observation. It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of physical and emotional sensations, but you're still choosing to stay present. Can you allow yourself to acknowledge the fear and tension, while also acknowledging your willingness to stay present, even in the midst of uncertainty?

Patient: I can try. It's just really hard to sit with this feeling. But I do want to be here, I want to be present. I just wish it wasn't so scary sometimes.

Therapist: That's a very brave thing to say. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the fear and still choose to be present. Can you take a deep breath and offer yourself some kindness, acknowledging that it's okay to feel scared and that you're doing the best you can, even when it's hard?

Patient: Okay, so I did messaged my friend. But I've been thinking, I can't just avoid social settings forever.

Therapist: That's a great realization. It sounds like you're recognizing that avoiding social settings isn't a solution, but rather a temporary coping mechanism. What small step could you take next to move closer to your valued life, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable?

Patient: Maybe I could try a small social gathering. I don't have to jump into a big party or anything, but maybe I could try meeting a couple of friends for coffee or something. Just a small step. But it's still scary to think about.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Meeting friends for coffee is a small and achievable step that can help you build confidence and move closer to your valued life. What would you say to yourself to help you feel more courageous about taking this step, even though it's still a bit scary?
