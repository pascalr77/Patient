# Transcript T11

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really stuck in my own head about work. I'm constantly worried about how my business is doing, if I'm making the right decisions. It's gotten so bad that I find myself putting off important tasks just to avoid the anxiety. It's like I'm spinning my wheels but not getting anywhere.

Therapist: You're really struggling with feeling stuck in your head about your business. When you think about making 'the right decisions,' what specifically are you hoping to achieve with those decisions?

Patient: I just want to keep the business afloat, you know? Make sure the bills are paid, the employees are happy. I want to see it grow, not just stagnate. But every decision feels so monumental, like one wrong move could tank everything. It's all just...a lot.

Therapist: That sense of overwhelm can be paralyzing. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "it's all just a lot"? What specifically feels like too much in this situation?

Patient: Like there's this endless to-do list in my head. I need to manage the day-to-day stuff—emails, invoices, meetings—but then there are the big picture things, like planning for growth, staying ahead of market trends. And right now, money is tight, so every decision feels make-or-break. It's like I'm trying to juggle a dozen things at once, and if I drop any of them, everything falls apart.

Therapist: It sounds like every decision feels like it could have catastrophic consequences. What does that feeling of everything falling apart do for you, even if it's not necessarily based in reality?

Patient: It just adds more pressure, I guess. Like, if I mess up, I won't just let myself down, but my employees too. They depend on me. It's not like I can just take a day off, there's too much at stake. It's just constant stress, constant worry. It's exhausting, but I can't just turn it off, you know?

Therapist: You can't just turn off the stress and worry, and that feels really limiting. What would it look like for you to take a step back, even for a short time, and give yourself permission to not have all the answers right now?

Patient: I don't know, honestly. It's hard to even imagine. Every time I try to step back, I just see all the things I should be doing instead. Like, if I take a break, all I can think about is the emails piling up, the calls I should be making. It's like I can't just pause my brain, you know? It's always going.

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is always on, and that feels like a big part of who you are. What would happen if you allowed yourself to experience a moment of quiet, just as a possibility, without judgment?

Patient: I don't know, really. I guess I'm afraid if I slow down, everything will fall apart. Like, if I'm not constantly pushing, then I'm failing. It's like I don't know how to just be still, even for a moment. It feels unproductive, I guess.

Therapist: The idea of being unproductive feels really threatening to you. What does being productive mean to you in the context of your business and your role as a leader?

Patient: Being productive means getting things done, checking tasks off the list. It means making progress, seeing growth, keeping everything on track. As the business owner, I feel like I have to set the pace, you know? If I'm not productive, how can I expect my employees to be? It's like, if I slow down, everything slows down.

Therapist: You feel like your employees are counting on you to set the pace, and that your productivity directly affects theirs. Can you think of a time when you noticed your employees being productive and motivated, even when you weren't directly pushing them to work at a certain pace?

Patient: Not really, no. I mean, I've seen them work well together on projects, but I always feel like I need to be there, guiding them, keeping them on track. I'm not sure they'd stay motivated if I wasn't constantly pushing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're assuming that you're the only one who can keep things on track. What would happen if you trusted that your employees are capable of working together effectively, even when you're not directly involved?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'm afraid they'll miss something, or things will fall through the cracks. It's hard to let go, you know? It's always been on me, so it's hard to trust someone else with it. But maybe they'd step up? It's just a risk, and I'm not sure I'm ready to take it.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of things falling through the cracks is really strong for you. What would you gain by taking the risk and trusting your employees to handle things, even if it means something goes wrong?

Patient: If I could trust them more, maybe I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed all the time. Maybe I could focus on the bigger stuff, the things only I can do. But that's scary too, because what if they can't handle it? What if something goes wrong and I have to fix it later? It's like, either way, I'm still responsible, you know? It's still on me.

Therapist: You feel like no matter what, you're still responsible for everything. What if that's not true? What if your responsibility lies not in controlling every detail, but in setting clear expectations and trusting your employees to meet them?

Patient: That's a hard shift to make. I mean, I get what you're saying, but it's not that easy. I've always been the one making sure everything is done right. It's tough to just let go of that. But I guess, maybe, it would free up some time and energy if I could trust them more. It's just...what if they don't meet the expectations? What then?

Therapist: You're worried about what would happen if your employees don't meet your expectations. What are you hoping for, exactly, when you have high expectations of them?

Patient: I guess I just want things to run smoothly, you know? I want to be able to delegate and not have to worry that things will go sideways. I want to be able to trust that they've got it handled. I just want everything to work like it should, without constant oversight.

Therapist: You want things to run smoothly and efficiently. What would it mean for you to live in a way that values simplicity and trust, rather than constant control and oversight?

Patient: I'm not sure, really. It sounds nice, I guess, but it also feels unrealistic. Like, sure, I'd love to just trust that everything is handled, that everyone is doing their job right. But that's not always the case, is it? People make mistakes, things slip through the cracks. I just can't afford for that to happen too much.

Therapist: You're worried that trusting others and letting go of control would lead to mistakes and errors. What would happen if you allowed yourself to take a risk and trust that mistakes are a natural part of growth and learning, rather than something to be avoided at all costs?

Patient: If I could see mistakes as growth, maybe I wouldn't be so stressed all the time. Maybe I could delegate more, focus on the bigger picture. But that's easier said than done. It's hard to watch things go wrong and not step in, you know? Especially when it's my business on the line. It's like, sure, mistakes happen, but they can also be really costly. It's a tough balance.

Therapist: You're weighing the potential costs of mistakes against the potential benefits of growth and learning. What if you saw mistakes not as a threat to your business, but as an opportunity to learn and improve, even if it means taking a risk and stepping back from control?

Patient: That's a big shift in mindset. I'm not sure I'm quite there yet. It's hard to see mistakes as opportunities when they feel like setbacks. But I guess, if I could see them that way, it might make it easier to trust others, to let go a bit. It's worth thinking about, at least.

Therapist: You mentioned letting go a bit. What would it look like for you to let go of some of that control and trust your employees to handle things, even if it means making mistakes?

Patient: I guess it would start with small steps. Maybe I don't micromanage every project, maybe I give them space to figure things out. It's not like I have to go all in right away, right? I could start with something small, see how it goes. But it's still scary, you know? It's hard to just let go.

Therapist: You're right, you don't have to make a drastic change all at once. What would be one small step you could take this week to give your employees more space to work on their own, without you micromanaging every detail?

Patient: Maybe I could start by not checking in on every little thing. Like, if I have a project delegated to someone, maybe I don't ask for updates every hour. Maybe I give them some space to work, and trust that they'll come to me if they need help. I don't know, that feels hard, but maybe it's a start.

Therapist: You're thinking of giving your employees more space to work, and that's a great start. What would happen if you could trust that you're already good at delegating and trusting others, even if it's just a little bit?

Patient: I don't know if I'm quite there yet. I mean, I can see where you're going with this, but it's hard to just trust that I'm already good at this when it feels so uncomfortable. It's like, I get it in theory, but putting it into practice is something else. I guess I could try to notice when I am delegating effectively, even if it's just small things. But it's still a work in progress.

Therapist: Noticing when you're delegating effectively can be a powerful way to build confidence. What would it look like for you to pay attention to the times when your employees are thriving and your delegation is working well?

Patient: I guess I could just make a mental note when I see them handling things well on their own. Like, when I delegate a task and it gets done right, maybe I acknowledge that, you know? Maybe I even tell them I notice their good work. It's not something I do enough, I guess. I'm always so focused on what's next, what's not done yet.

Therapist: You're always focused on what's next, what's not done yet. What would it be like for you to bring your attention to the present moment, to notice and appreciate what's already being done well, rather than just focusing on what still needs to be done?

Patient: Easier said than done. I mean, I get what you're saying, but it's hard to just turn off that voice in my head that's always pushing for more. But maybe I could try to pause, just briefly, and acknowledge what's going well. I don't know, it feels a bit unnatural, but I could give it a try.

Therapist: You're willing to try pausing and acknowledging what's going well. What would it mean for you to acknowledge that your employees' successes are a reflection of their own hard work and abilities, rather than solely your own management?
