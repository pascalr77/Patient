# Transcript T36

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've just been feeling really overwhelmed. I'm teaching full-time, just moved to a new city, and I find myself working all the time. It's like if I stop, all these feelings come rushing in, so I just keep going. It's getting to be too much.

Therapist: What are some of these feelings that you're afraid will come rushing in if you stop working? What's the nature of those feelings, and how do they make you feel when they show up?

Patient: I'm not really sure, it's just... a lot. Like, I feel anxious, I guess. And kinda sad too. It's all just too much to deal with, so it's easier to just keep working. When they do show up, I feel like I can't handle it, like I'm drowning or something. I don't know, it's hard to explain.

Therapist: You feel like you're drowning when these emotions show up. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to feel overwhelmed, rather than trying to keep working all the time? What might you gain or lose by stopping and facing those feelings?

Patient: I don't know, really. I guess I'm afraid if I stop, I might just... break down. Like, if I let myself feel all that stuff, I won't be able to handle it. I might fall apart, and then I won't be any good to anyone. But, I dunno, maybe if I actually deal with it, it'll stop following me around? It's just hard to imagine actually doing that, you know? It's scary.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that if you stop avoiding your emotions, you'll lose control and not be able to function. What do you think would happen if you did "break down" – what's the worst-case scenario, and what would that mean for your life and relationships?

Patient: If I break down, I might not be able to get out of bed, or do anything really. I'll let everyone down – my students, my colleagues, my friends. They all rely on me, you know? I don't want to be a burden. What if I can't handle it and everything just falls apart? I could lose my job, my friends... everything. It's just too risky.

Therapist: You mention not wanting to be a burden and feeling responsible for others. What's most important to you in this situation – being able to provide for and take care of others, or taking care of yourself and dealing with your own emotions?

Patient: I guess, a part of me knows I should take care of myself, but it's hard. I mean, I've always been the one others rely on. I can't just let them down. But at the same time, I'm really struggling here. I just don't know how to do both, you know? It's like I can't find a balance.

Therapist: You mention being the one others rely on – that's a big part of your identity, isn't it? What would happen to your sense of self if you were to start prioritizing your own needs and well-being, even if it means disappointing others for a little while?

Patient: Yeah, it is. I'm not sure, really. I guess I'm afraid that if I start saying no and looking after myself, people will think I'm selfish. Or maybe they'll realize I'm not as strong as they thought. I don't want people to see me differently. But at the same time, I'm just so tired.

Therapist: You're worried that if you start taking care of yourself, people will see you as selfish or weak. What do you think would happen if you were to be seen that way – would that be the end of the world, or is there something else going on beneath that concern?

Patient: I don't know, maybe it's just that... if people see me like that, then maybe it's true, you know? Maybe I am weak, or maybe I am selfish. And if that's true, then what? It's just... it's hard to even think about it. I just want to be good enough, I guess.

Therapist: You want to be "good enough," which sounds like a big deal to you. What does "good enough" mean to you – is it about meeting others' expectations, or is it about something more internal, like feeling confident or capable in your own right?

Patient: Good question. I think it's a bit of both. I want people to be happy with me, you know? But also, I want to feel like I'm... worth something, I guess. Like I'm doing something important. It's just hard to feel that way when I'm so tired and overwhelmed all the time.

Therapist: You want to feel like you're doing something important and worth something. What would be something that would make you feel like you're living in line with your values, even if it's just for a small moment or in a small way?

Patient: Hmm, that's tough. I guess, maybe just being able to enjoy something again? Like, reading a book for fun, not just to plan a lesson. Or maybe going for a walk and actually appreciating it, instead of thinking about work the whole time. Just something small, where I can feel like I'm living my life, not just working all the time. But it's hard, it's like I don't even know how to do that anymore.

Therapist: You mention wanting to enjoy things like reading and taking walks again. What do you think would be a non-negotiable for you – something that, no matter what, you would want to make time for, even if it's just for a few minutes a day?

Patient: I'm not sure. Maybe just having a few minutes to myself, just to breathe. Like, really breathe, you know? Not just rushing from one thing to the next. But even that feels hard sometimes. It's like I don't even know how to relax anymore.

Therapist: You talk about needing to breathe and be still. What if, for just a minute, you were to let go of the need to do or achieve anything – just be present in this moment, with no expectations or pressures? What would that feel like, and is that something you can even imagine?

Patient: I don't know. It's been so long since I've just... been still. I think it would feel weird, maybe even uncomfortable at first. But maybe, just maybe, it would be a relief too. I'm not sure I can even imagine it, but I think I'd like to try. Just for a minute.

Therapist: That's a great place to start – just one minute. I'd like to offer you an exercise. Close your eyes, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow yourself to settle into your body, letting go of any tension or strain. Just be present with your breath, without trying to change anything or achieve anything. Can you do that for me?

Patient: I can try.

Therapist: Take your time, and when you're ready, notice what arises as you sit with your breath. What do you notice in your body, in your mind, or in your emotions?

Patient: Okay, I'm back. I guess I notice my shoulders are really tight, like I'm carrying something heavy. And my mind, it's racing a bit. Lots of little thoughts popping in and out. And I don't know, I feel a bit sad maybe, but also a bit relieved. It's kind of mixed up.

Therapist: That's a rich experience. You mention your shoulders feeling tight, your mind racing, and feeling both sad and relieved. It sounds like your body and mind are holding onto a lot of tension and stress. What if, rather than trying to change or fix anything, you were to allow yourself to simply observe these experiences – to be with them, rather than trying to push them away or get rid of them?

Patient: But isn't that just... giving up? Like, if I just observe it, isn't that just accepting that I'm always gonna feel this way? I don't want to feel like this forever.

Therapist: Observing your experience isn't about accepting that you'll always feel this way, but rather about being present with what is, in this moment. It's not about giving up, but about taking a step back to see things more clearly. Can you think of a time when you were able to see something from a different perspective, like a puzzle piece you hadn't noticed before? Maybe this is like that – a chance to see your experience in a new way.

Patient: Maybe. I mean, I guess there have been times when I've looked at something differently and realized I wasn't seeing the whole picture. But this feels different, you know? It's my life, not a puzzle. It's just hard to think about seeing it differently when it feels so... big.

Therapist: You're right, this is about your life, and it's big. But sometimes, making small changes can add up over time. What if, instead of trying to tackle everything at once, you were to take one small step towards seeing your life in a new way – just one small step?

Patient: I guess that wouldn't be so bad. But I don't know what that small step would be. I don't want to do anything too crazy.

Therapist: That's okay, taking a small step doesn't have to be crazy. What if you were to commit to doing one thing this week that's not work-related? Something as simple as going for a short walk, or reading a chapter in a book, or even just making a cup of tea in the morning without checking your phone. Would that feel like a small step you could take?

Patient: I guess I can do that. Maybe a short walk, like around the block. I can try that. But what if I can't do it? What if I get too busy or something?

Therapist: You're right, things can get busy, and it's okay if you don't get to take that walk. The goal isn't to take a walk every day, but to take one small step towards taking care of yourself. If you get busy, you can always try again another day. What if, instead of focusing on not getting it wrong, you focused on taking that one step, and then seeing what happens next?

Patient: Okay. I'll try. Just one walk. I can do that.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try. Remember, it's just one walk. You don't have to do anything more than that. And when you do take that walk, I want you to come back here and tell me about it. What did you experience, and what did you notice?

Patient: Alright, I'll come back and tell you about it. But what if it's nothing special? What if I don't notice anything?

Therapist: That's a great question. But what if the goal isn't to notice something profound or special, but to simply take a step towards taking care of yourself? What if the walk itself is enough, regardless of what happens or what you notice?

Patient: Hmm. Okay, I see your point. I'll just focus on taking the walk, and not worry so much about what happens. I can do that.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember, it's not about the outcome, but about taking care of yourself and being present in the moment. I'm proud of you for taking this step, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience when you come back.
