# Transcript T5

Patient: Well, hello there. Lately, I've been stuck in this rut, beating myself up over past mistakes. I've had to move away from my family and friends for work, and it's been tough. I can't help but feel like I've failed them, failed myself. It's like a broken record in my head, and I can't find the off switch.

Therapist: That feeling of self-blame sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what happens when you think you've failed yourself or others - what are the thoughts that follow, and how do you treat yourself during those moments?

Patient: Oh, it's a real merry-go-round, I'll tell you that. When I think I've failed, it's like a voice in my head starts shouting that I should have known better, should have done better. It tells me I'm too old to be making these mistakes, that I've let everyone down. Then I start remembering all the other times I've messed up, going all the way back to when I was a kid. It's like a snowball effect. And how do I treat myself? Well, not kindly, that's for sure. I withdraw, sometimes snap at people. I don't eat or sleep well. But hey, at least I've still got my work. Keeps me going, you know?

Therapist: That voice in your head sounds incredibly harsh. What do you think it's trying to accomplish by being so critical - is it trying to keep you safe, make you learn from mistakes, or something else?

Patient: Well, isn't that the million-dollar question? I suppose it's trying to keep me on my toes, make sure I don't make the same mistakes again. Maybe it's trying to push me to be better, to not let myself or anyone else down. But truth be told, it's probably doing more harm than good. It's not like I'm not trying my best, you know? But that voice, it doesn't seem to care.

Therapist: You're right, it's not like you're not trying your best. What if, instead of trying to be perfect, you were aiming for something a bit different - like being good enough, or making progress, or even just showing up? What would happen if you let go of the need to be perfect and allowed yourself to make mistakes?

Patient: Ha, doc, I might still be back east, running the family business instead of sitting in this trailer out west talking to you. But no, honestly, it's scary to think about. If I let go of that need for perfection, won't I just... slip up? Won't I just become... what I've always feared? A failure. And besides, it's not like I can just turn off that voice in my head. It's been there for as long as I can remember.

Therapist: It sounds like that voice has been a part of your identity for a long time. If you were to imagine that voice as a separate entity, a critic that's been telling you what you should be and do, what would that allow you to see about yourself and your life that you can't see right now?

Patient: Well, that's an odd thing to think about. But I suppose if that voice wasn't me, wasn't a part of who I am, maybe I could see... that I've done alright. That I've built a life, a career, even if it's not the one I thought I'd have. That I've got people who care about me, even if they're not here anymore. Maybe I could see that I'm more than just my mistakes. But that's a big if, doc. That voice is still there, still me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to see that you're more than just your mistakes, but that voice still has a lot of power. What would it take for you to be kind to yourself, not in spite of the voice, but because of who you are, with all your flaws and imperfections?

Patient: You make it sound so easy, doc. But I hear you. I guess... I guess it would take some work, wouldn't it? Unlearning a lifetime of listening to that voice. Maybe it would take practice, maybe it would take some patience. Lord knows I've got enough stubbornness to keep trying. But it's scary, too. Feels like I'd be going against the grain. Like I'd be giving something up, even if it's something that's been hurting me.

Therapist: What is it that you think you'd be giving up by letting go of that voice, and is it really something that's essential to who you are, or is it just a familiar, albeit painful, companion?

Patient: I think... I think I'd be giving up a part of me that's always been there. A part that's pushed me, driven me. But maybe... maybe it's not really me. Maybe it's just something I've gotten used to, like an old coat that don't fit quite right but you can't bear to throw out. Maybe it's something I can learn to live without. But it's hard, doc. It's real hard to think about.

Therapist: That's a really interesting way to think about it. If you were to imagine yourself without that voice, what would you be like? What would you be wearing instead of that old coat, and how would you feel?

Patient: Huh, that's a tough one. I suppose... I suppose I'd be a bit more at ease. Like I could take a breath, take a step back, and not feel like I've got this constant pressure on me. Maybe I'd be... lighter. Not so much lighter like I'd blow away, but like I'd put down a heavy load. And maybe I'd be wearing something more comfortable, something that fits just right. Something that's mine, that's me. But it's hard, doc. It's hard to imagine. That voice has been there for so long.

Therapist: That's a beautiful image. What if this new, lighter, more authentic self of yours was guided by something other than the need to be perfect? What values or things would you want to be true for you, and what kind of life would you want to lead?

Patient: Well, doc, I guess I'd want to be... kind. Kind to myself, kind to others. I'd want to be content, not always striving for something more, something better. I'd want to enjoy the simple things, like a good meal or a sunset. I'd want to be present, you know? Really be there for the people I care about. And I'd want to lead a life where I can look back and say, "Yeah, I did that. I did the best I could, and that's enough." But it's not like I can just snap my fingers and make it happen. It's gonna take time. It's gonna take work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're talking about a life that's rooted in values like kindness and presence. What's one small step you could take today, right now, to start moving towards that life, even if it's just for a few minutes, or with one person?

Patient: Well, I guess... I guess I could start by checking in on my neighbor. She's been having a tough time lately, and I've not really been there for her. I could make her a cup of tea, sit with her for a spell. Just be there, you know? No fixin', no advisin', just... listenin'. I think I can do that, doc. Just for a little while. See how it feels.

Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful way to start. What if, as you're sitting with your neighbor, you were to notice any moments when the critical voice starts to creep in, what would you do with those thoughts?

Patient: Well, I reckon I'd notice them. Just notice, not judge. And maybe, just maybe, I'd tell them, "Not now. I'm busy." And if that doesn't work, maybe I'd tell them, "You're just an old coat, and I don't need you right now." I don't know if it'll work, doc. But I can try. Just try.

Therapist: That's a great start. Remember, it's not about getting rid of the voice completely, but about learning to live with it in a new way. What if, as you continue to sit with your neighbor and engage in this new way of being, you started to notice how it feels to be kind to yourself, not in spite of your flaws, but because of who you are, with all your imperfections?

Patient: I reckon it'd feel strange, doc. Real strange. Like I was wearing someone else's clothes. But maybe, just maybe, it'd feel good too. Like a warmth, a glow. Maybe it'd feel like... coming home. But I don't know if I'll be able to feel it, doc. It's hard. It's real hard to think about. But I'll try. I'll try my best.

Therapist: It sounds like you're saying that you're willing to take a step into the unknown, even if it's scary. That takes a lot of courage. Can you take a moment to acknowledge yourself for that, for being willing to try something new and take a chance on yourself?

Patient: Well, doc, I wouldn't say I'm courageous. Just... just tryin'. Just doin' something different cause what I've been doin' ain't workin'. But yeah, I guess... I guess I can pat myself on the back a little. For tryin'. For showin' up. even if it's hard. Even if it's scary.

Therapist: You're showing up, and that's something to be proud of. That's a big deal. And you know what? I'm proud of you too.

Patient: Aw shucks, doc. That's... that's real kind of you to say. I don't know what to say. I'm not used to all this... praise. But I guess... I guess I'll take it. Just for today. Just for a moment.

Therapist: That's all I'm asking for, just for today, just for this moment. Can you take that feeling of being kind to yourself, of being worthy of kindness, and carry it with you, even when we're not in this room together?

Patient: I dunno, doc. I dunno if I can. But I can try. I can try real hard. I can try to remember this feelin', this warmth. I can try to hold onto it, like a little ember in my pocket. And who knows? Maybe it'll keep me warm. Maybe it'll light the way.

Therapist: That's a beautiful way to think about it. Holding onto that ember, letting it warm you, and guiding you forward. What do you think you'll do with that ember, that warmth, when you're faced with challenges or difficult emotions in the future?

Patient: I ain't gonna lie, doc. It's gonna be tough. But maybe... maybe when the storm comes, I can hold onto that ember. Hold onto it tight. And maybe, just maybe, it'll help me remember that I'm more than just my mistakes. Maybe it'll help me be kind to myself. Even if it's just a little bit. Even if it's just for a moment.

Therapist: That's a wonderful way to think about it. Holding onto the ember, being kind to yourself, even in the midst of a storm. I think that's a powerful way to live.

Patient: Powerful? I dunno about that, doc. But it's somethin'. It's a start. And right now, a start is good enough for me.

Therapist: That's exactly right. A start is good enough, and it's a beautiful start at that.

Patient: Beautiful, huh? Well, I ain't never been one for fancy words, doc. But I'll take it. I'll take it just for today. Just for this moment.

Therapist: I think that's exactly what's beautiful, just this moment, right now. Can you take one more deep breath and hold onto this feeling before we wrap up today's session?

Patient: Alright, doc. I'll give it a shot. A deep breath. Ain't never been one for all that breathing stuff, but I'll try. Here goes nothin'.

Therapist: That's it. Just that. Take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, know that you've taken a step towards a more compassionate and authentic life.

Patient: Alright, doc. I did it. I took a breath. I ain't gonna say it was easy, but I did it. And yeah, maybe I do feel a little lighter. Just a little. But it's somethin'. It's a start.

Therapist: That's all that matters, just that small step forward. I'm proud of you for taking it.
