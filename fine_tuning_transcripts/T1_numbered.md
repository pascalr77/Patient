# Transcript T1

[1]

Patient: I've been feeling really stuck lately. I can't stop beating myself up over losing my job
         and my partner leaving. It's like I can't escape these cycles of self-criticism. It reminds
         me of feeling this same way growing up, and I just feel like I can't make any lasting
         changes in my life.

Therapist: That self-criticism can be really suffocating. When you say you're beating yourself up,
           what do you think you're trying to achieve or avoid by doing that?


[2]

Patient: I don't know really. It's just a habit I've always had. Maybe I think if I'm hard on
         myself, it'll motivate me to change? But it mostly just makes me feel worse. I guess I'm
         also trying to avoid feeling like I'm not good enough, but it doesn't seem to be working.
         It's like I can't help myself.

Therapist: It sounds like being hard on yourself hasn't been motivating you to make lasting changes,
           and it's actually worsening your feelings. What's it like when you say you feel like you
           "can't help" yourself? Is there a part of you that's trying to change, but another part
           is holding you back?


[3]

Patient: Yeah, that's exactly it. There's a part of me that wants to move forward and do better, but
         then there's this other part that just drags me down. It's like I'm stuck in quicksand, the
         more I struggle, the worse it gets. I just feel so tired of fighting with myself all the
         time.

Therapist: The quicksand metaphor is really vivid. What if, instead of struggling against the
           quicksand, you were to step out of it and observe it from the side? What would you see?


[4]

Patient: If I could step out and look at it, I guess I'd see someone who's really trying, but just
         keeps getting pulled down by all these negative thoughts. I'd see someone who's exhausted
         and maybe a bit scared, too. It's like watching someone stuck in a loop, doing the same
         thing over and over, expecting a different result.

Therapist: That's a really kind and accurate picture of yourself. What if this observer, the one who
           can see you stuck in the quicksand, were to speak to you right now? What advice or
           encouragement would it offer?


[5]

Patient: I'm not sure. Maybe it would say something like, "It's okay to be kind to yourself. You
         don't have to be so hard on yourself all the time. You're doing the best you can, and
         that's enough for now." But it's hard to really believe that, you know? It's like I need
         permission or something.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a kind of internal validation, a sense of being okay
           with yourself. What if you didn't need anyone's permission to be kind to yourself? What
           values would you be living in alignment with if you were able to treat yourself with
           compassion and understanding?


[6]

Patient: I never really thought about it that way. If I didn't need permission, I guess I'd be
         living in line with values like self-acceptance and trusting myself more. Maybe even
         feeling more at peace? It's a nice thought but I am not sure I can do this.

Therapist: That's a beautiful vision for yourself. What's one small step, just one tiny step, that
           you could take today to start moving in the direction of self-acceptance and trusting
           yourself more?


[7]

Patient: I'm not really sure. Maybe just trying to notice when I start beating myself up? I don't
         know if I can stop it, but maybe I can just notice it and then... I don't know what to do
         next. This is harder than I thought.

Therapist: That's a great start, noticing when you're beating yourself up. What's the worst that
           could happen if you simply acknowledged it, without trying to stop it or change it, just
           noticed it as it is?


[8]

Patient: I guess the worst that could happen is that I'd feel really uncomfortable or maybe even
         more anxious. It feels strange to just notice it without trying to stop it, like I'm
         accepting something that feels unacceptable. But maybe it wouldn't be as bad as I think?
         I'm really not sure. This feels odd.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that noticing your thoughts without trying to change them
           would mean you're accepting them as true, but what if it's more about accepting your
           experience as it is, rather than accepting the thoughts themselves? What's the value or
           principle that's more important to you: avoiding discomfort or living truthfully with
           yourself?


[9]

Patient: I never thought about it like that. I guess living truthfully with myself is more
         important, even if it's uncomfortable. But it's still scary. A part of me wants to just
         keep doing things the way I always have, even if it's not really working. I guess if I were
         to try just noticing, maybe I could try to be more honest with myself about what I'm
         feeling, instead of trying to push it away or fix it. That still feels hard but maybe it's
         worth trying.

Therapist: That's a huge step forward, recognizing that honesty with yourself is worth trying. What
           would you say to yourself if you were being completely honest about how you're feeling
           right now? What would you acknowledge about your experience?


[10]

Patient: I guess if I'm being really honest, I feel really overwhelmed and scared. I feel like I'm
         stuck and I don't know how to move forward. I'm also feeling really tired of being so hard
         on myself all the time, but it's hard to know how to change that. It's like I want to move
         forward, but I'm also terrified of failing again.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of failing again is really holding you back. What if, instead of
           trying to avoid failure, you were to approach it as an opportunity to learn and grow?
           What would you be trying to achieve or learn from the experience of failing?


[11]

Patient: That's a hard question. I guess if I could see failure as an opportunity, maybe I'd be
         trying to learn more about what I really want and need. Maybe I'd be trying to achieve a
         better understanding of myself and maybe even some self-compassion? It's still really hard
         to see it that way, but maybe it's worth trying.

Therapist: It sounds like there's still a part of you that's resisting this new perspective. What
           would you say to that part of you, the one that's still holding onto the fear of failure?


[12]

Patient: I guess I'd say, "I get that you're scared, and that's okay. I hear you." But also, "Maybe
         it's worth trying something new, even if it doesn't work out perfectly." It's still hard to
         really believe that, but maybe I can try to be open to it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step by acknowledging your fear and being willing to
           try something new. What if, in the next week, you were to take one small action towards
           something that scares you, just to see what happens? Not to achieve a specific outcome,
           but simply to experience the uncertainty and see what you can learn from it.


[13]

Patient: That sounds really challenging. I'm not sure what I would even do. I guess maybe I could
         try applying for a job, even if I don't think I'm qualified? Just to see what happens? It's
         still really scary and I am not sure I can do it but it's a thought, maybe I can try to be
         honest with myself about the experience.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a part of you that's doubting your ability to apply for the job.
           What would happen if you were to acknowledge that doubt, and still decide to take the
           action anyway? What would you say to yourself about your ability to handle the
           uncertainty and potential outcome?


[14]

Patient: If I acknowledge the doubt and still decide to apply, I guess I'd say something like,
         "Okay, I'm feeling really unsure about this, but let's just see what happens. I can handle
         the uncertainty. Maybe I won't get the job, but that's alright. I'll still learn something
         from the experience, no matter what." It's still hard to really believe that, but maybe I
         can try to be open to the possibility.

Therapist: It sounds like you're developing a more curious and open mindset, even in the face of
           uncertainty. What if, in the next week, you were to approach one other area of your life
           with a similar sense of curiosity and openness? For example, what if you were to try a
           new hobby or activity, not with the goal of succeeding, but simply to see what happens
           and learn from the experience?


[15]

Patient: I'm not really sure. I guess maybe I could try that painting class I've been thinking
         about? But what if I'm no good at it? I guess that's the point though, isn't it? To just
         try it and see what happens, even if it's not perfect. I guess I can try to approach it
         with more curiosity, but it's hard to not want to be good at it right away. I'll think
         about it.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a part of you that's attached to the idea of being good at the
           painting class right away. What if, instead of focusing on being good, you were to focus
           on the process of creating and exploring your own unique expression? What would that look
           like, and what might you learn from the experience?


[16]

Patient: I guess if I focused more on the process, I'd probably be less anxious about making
         mistakes. Maybe it would look like me just playing around with the paint, trying different
         things, and not worrying so much about the end result. I guess I could learn that it's okay
         to experiment and make mistakes, and maybe even have fun with it. It's still hard to let go
         of that need to be good at it, but maybe I can try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress in being more open to the experience.
           What if, in the next week, you were to commit to showing up to the painting class with a
           sense of curiosity and openness, and not just going through the motions? What would that
           look like, and what would you do if you felt like you wanted to give up or get
           frustrated?


[17]

Patient: That sounds really hard. I guess it would look like me actively trying new techniques,
         asking questions, maybe even talking to the other people there, which is scary for me. If I
         felt like giving up, I guess I could acknowledge that feeling and maybe take a break,
         instead of just leaving entirely. I could remind myself that it's just a class, there's no
         pressure, and I'm there to learn and explore, not be perfect. I don't know, it's still
         really uncomfortable for me but I guess I can try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step by acknowledging the discomfort and committing to
           showing up to the class. What if, instead of trying to avoid the discomfort, you were to
           lean into it, and see what you can learn from it? What would that look like, and what
           might you discover about yourself in the process?


[18]

Patient: I'm not really sure what that would look like. Maybe it would be like trying to be present
         with the discomfort, acknowledging it, and then doing the thing anyway. I don't know what
         I'd discover about myself, but maybe I'd learn that I can handle more than I thought I
         could? It's still really hard to imagine doing that, but I guess I can try to be open to
         it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step by being open to discovering more about yourself.
           What if, in the next week, you were to approach one other area of your life with a
           similar sense of curiosity and openness, and see what you can learn about yourself and
           the world around you?


[19]

Patient: I don't know, that sounds really overwhelming. I'm not sure I'm ready for that. I guess I
         could try to be more open with a friend, maybe share a little more about what I'm going
         through, instead of just keeping it all to myself. But that's really scary for me. I'd have
         to really trust that person for me to do that. I don't think I am ready to do that just
         yet. Maybe I'll just think about it for now.

Therapist: It sounds like trust is a big issue for you. What if, instead of trying to trust someone
           else, you were to focus on building trust with yourself? What would that look like, and
           how could you start to develop more self-trust in your daily life?


[20]

Patient: I'm not really sure how to build trust with myself. I guess it would look like me being
         more honest with myself, maybe following through on the things I say I'm going to do, even
         if they're small. I think in the past, I haven't followed through on promises to myself, so
         it's hard to trust that I'll actually do what I say I will. It's like I don't take myself
         seriously. It's still hard to know where to start, but maybe I can try to be more mindful
         of it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're being really honest with yourself about your struggles with
           self-trust. What if, instead of beating yourself up for not following through in the
           past, you were to treat yourself with kindness and compassion, just as you would a close
           friend who made the same mistake? What would that look like, and how could you start to
           practice self-compassion in your daily life?
