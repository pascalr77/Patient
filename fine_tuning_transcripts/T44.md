# Transcript T44

Patient: Lately, I've been feeling stuck in a rut. I've been worrying non-stop about my performance at work, and it's led to this cycle of procrastination that I can't seem to break. It's like the more I worry about doing things perfectly, the less I actually get done. It's been really frustrating and isolating.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. What does "doing things perfectly" mean to you in the context of your work?

Patient: Well, in the kitchen, it's all about precision and consistency. Every plate should look and taste the same, no matter how many times you make it. But lately, I've been feeling like I'm falling short of that standard. It's like I'm one step behind, always.

Therapist: You mentioned being "one step behind." What do you think would happen if you served a dish that wasn't perfect, not just to your customers but to yourself?

Patient: I guess I fear that if I serve something that's not perfect, I'll lose the respect of my team, my customers and myself too. I suppose it feels like I'd be letting everyone down, including myself. It's like all those years of experience and hard work would suddenly mean nothing, just because of one less-than-perfect dish. It's a bit irrational when I think about it, honestly. But it's hard to shake off that feeling, you know?

Therapist: What do you think would be the worst part of losing the respect of yourself, your team, and your customers? Is there something you're trying to protect by holding onto this perfection, even if it's causing you to feel stuck?

Patient: I think the worst part would be feeling like a failure. Like I've lost my purpose, my identity. I've always prided myself on my high standards, and if I let that go, I'm not sure what's left. It's like I'm trying to protect this image of myself as someone who can always deliver excellence. But maybe that's just a story I've been telling myself? It's confusing, to be honest.

Therapist: You mention this "image" of yourself as someone who delivers excellence. Can you imagine what values or qualities about yourself would be at risk if you weren't defined by that image?

Patient: That's a tough question. I guess I'd worry that without that image, people might see me as weak or incapable. Or maybe that I'm not as dedicated as I should be. But also, I might be at risk of feeling exposed and vulnerable. It's like this image has been a shield, you know? It's scary to think about what might happen if I were to ever put it down.

Therapist: You mention this image being a shield. What do you think would happen if you were to take a step back from this shield, even just for a moment, and not worry about what others might think?

Patient: If I were to take a step back from this shield, even just for a moment... I don't know, maybe I'd feel a sense of relief? But also, probably a lot of anxiety. It's like I've been so focused on everyone else's perceptions that I've lost touch with what I really want or need. I think there might be a part of me that's afraid if I let go of that shield, everything might just fall apart, me included. It's a bit overwhelming to think about, honestly.

Therapist: You mention feeling overwhelmed by the thought of everything falling apart. What if, instead of trying to hold everything together, you were to focus on what's essential to you, even if it means things might not be perfect?

Patient: If I were to focus on what's essential to me... I'm not even sure what that would look like. I've been so caught up in trying to keep everything together that I've lost sight of what's really important to me. I guess part of me thinks that if I can't do it all perfectly, then I shouldn't bother trying. But maybe that's just setting myself up for failure? It's all a bit confusing, really. I'm not sure where to start.

Therapist: What if "perfect" wasn't the only option? What if you could allow yourself to take imperfect action towards what you value, even if it doesn't meet your high standards?

Patient: I'm not sure I even know how to do that. It's like I've been so focused on avoiding failure that I've forgotten how to just... do things for the sake of doing them. It's a strange thought, to be honest. But part of me thinks that maybe, just maybe, it might be worth a try. I'm just not sure how.

Therapist: What's one small thing you could do today, in the kitchen or in your work, that aligns with your values, even if you don't do it perfectly?

Patient: Maybe I could try out a new recipe, just for fun. Not for the menu, not for anyone else, just for me. Something simple, something I wouldn't normally try because it's not "up to standard." Maybe that would be a start? Just something small, no pressure.

Therapist: That sounds like a great starting point. What would it take for you to commit to trying this new recipe, just for the sake of trying it, without worrying about how it turns out?

Patient: I think I'd need to give myself permission to fail. To really, truly, let go of the expectation that it has to be perfect, or even good. I guess that's scary in its own way, but also maybe a little exciting? Like I'm breaking the rules or something. I think I can commit to that, just this once.

Therapist: What would it mean for you to actually allow yourself to fail in this situation? What would you say to yourself if you ended up with a dish that didn't turn out as expected?

Patient: Allowing myself to fail would mean accepting that not everything I do has to be a masterpiece. If the dish doesn't turn out as expected, I guess I'd tell myself that it's just one dish, just one try. It's not the end of the world if it's not perfect. Maybe I could even learn something from it? But I think I'd also need to remind myself to be kind to myself, not to beat myself up if it doesn't work out. That's harder than it sounds, though.

Therapist: What would it take for you to be kind to yourself in that moment of imperfection? What words or actions could you take to offer yourself compassion and understanding?

Patient: I think I'd need to acknowledge that I tried, and that's enough. Maybe I could say something like, "It's okay, you gave it a shot. That's what matters." I guess I'd take a moment to appreciate the process, the trying, rather than just focusing on the result.

Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful way to approach it. Can you imagine taking that same approach with other areas of your life, like your work or your relationships, where you might feel the need to achieve perfection?

Patient: It's hard to imagine, honestly. I've been so stuck in this perfection mindset for so long. But yeah, maybe if I could just appreciate the trying, it wouldn't feel so daunting. Like, maybe I could tell myself, "You're doing your best, and that's enough." But I think I'd need to practice that, a lot. It doesn't come naturally to me.

Therapist: That's completely fair. Practicing self-compassion and focusing on effort takes time and repetition. Would you be willing to commit to taking a few minutes each day to reflect on your efforts, acknowledging what you've done well, and telling yourself, "You're doing your best, and that's enough"?

Patient: I can try. It feels a bit strange, but maybe that's the point? I can commit to giving it a shot, at least. Baby steps, right? I won't promise I'll be good at it, but I'll try.

Therapist: That's a great start. Remember, it's not about being good at it, it's about being kind to yourself and acknowledging your efforts. That's a huge step forward. Can you take a moment to acknowledge that you're taking this step, and that it's a start towards a more compassionate and values-driven approach?

Patient: Yeah, I guess I am taking a step forward. I hadn't really thought of it that way. It's not much, but it's something. And that's... that's a good thing. I'm trying, at least. That's worth something, right?

Therapist: That's exactly right. Taking small steps and acknowledging your efforts is worth something. It's a sign that you're moving forward, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: Yeah, I guess I am a bit proud of myself. That's not something I usually feel, to be honest. It's like I'm so used to focusing on what's next, on what I haven't done, that I forget to appreciate what I have done. This is different. It's gonna take some getting used to, but it's a good start.

Therapist: That's a beautiful shift. What would it take for you to continue to cultivate this sense of pride and appreciation for your efforts, rather than getting caught up in what's next or what you haven't done?

Patient: I think I'd need to remind myself to pause more often, to look back at what I've done so far. Maybe keep a record of it, somehow. Like a journal, maybe? It's not really my thing, but who knows, it could help. I guess I just need to keep practicing this, keep reminding myself that it's okay to feel proud of my efforts. That it's okay to not always be looking ahead. It's gonna be tough, but I think I can try it.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Keeping a journal can be a powerful way to reflect on your progress and acknowledge your efforts. Would you be willing to commit to writing down three things you're proud of each week, no matter how small they may seem?

Patient: Three things a week? Yeah, I think I can do that. It might be a bit challenging at first, but I'll give it a shot. Like I said, baby steps. I'll start this week, see how it goes. Who knows, maybe it'll help more than I think.

Therapist: That's a great commitment to make. Remember, it's not about the quantity of things you're proud of, but about the quality of your self-reflection and self-compassion. I'm proud of you for taking this step, and I'm here to support you as you continue on this journey.

Patient: Thanks. It means a lot to have that support. I'm not sure what I'm doing, really, but I guess that's the point. I'll try my best, and we'll see how it goes.

Therapist: I'm here to support you, and I'll be here to help you explore and learn as you take these steps.

Patient: Okay. Let's do this.
