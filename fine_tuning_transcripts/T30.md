# Transcript T30

Patient: I've been finding it hard to get through the days lately. Since I lost my partner a few months back, it's like nothing seems to matter anymore. I'm not sure if I should even be here talking to you. My work has been piling up, and even my closest relationships feel like a chore.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough and isolating experience. What's one thing you were looking forward to doing or enjoying before your partner passed away that you've put off or haven't been able to do since?

Patient: I don't know if there's anything specific. I mean, we used to go on walks together, but now it just feels like there's no point.

Therapist: That sounds like a really painful change. When you say it feels like there's no point, what does that mean to you - that there's no joy in it, no value, or something else?

Patient: It's just lonely. Everything feels lonely now.

Therapist: That loneliness can feel overwhelming. Are there any small moments, like seeing a friend, talking to a family member, or even just looking at a photo, that give you a tiny sense of connection or comfort, even if it's brief?

Patient: I have my moments with my grandkids. They make me smile, but it's not the same. It's hard to explain, I guess.

Therapist: Those moments with your grandkids must be precious. What is it about your relationship with your partner that feels missing in those moments with your grandkids, or what do you think is the key difference that makes it feel like it's not the same?

Patient: It's just not the same as having someone who knows you inside and out. The kids, they don't understand that part of me. She did. It was a shared history, you know? A whole life together.

Therapist: That shared history and understanding can be a powerful bond. What do you think was the most important part of having someone who knew you so deeply, and how do you think that's affected your relationships since losing her, especially with your grandkids?

Patient: I guess it was just the comfort of it. We didn't have to explain ourselves to each other. It made life easy. Now with the grandkids, I don't really do well when people don't understand me.

Therapist: That must be really challenging, feeling like you have to explain yourself more. What do you do when you feel like people, like the grandkids, don't understand you, and what does that feel like for you - is it a sense of frustration, hurt, or something else?

Patient: I just go quiet, I guess. It's just easier that way. It's not frustration, really. More like... resignation. I just don't have it in me to try to make someone else understand. Not anymore.

Therapist: That resignation can be a heavy burden to carry. What does it mean to you to be understood, and is there a part of you that's worried you're losing touch with that aspect of yourself, that you're not being your authentic self in these relationships?

Patient: Never really thought about it that way. I guess I just miss being known. Really known, you know? Like, all my quirks and memories and all that. And no, I don't feel like I'm being very genuine these days. It's like I don't have the energy for it.

Therapist: That sense of being known and understood can be a fundamental part of feeling connected. What do you think is draining your energy, is it the grief, the daily responsibilities, or something else entirely that's making it hard for you to show up as your authentic self?

Patient: It's the grief, plain and simple. It's just a black hole, sucking the life out of me. I just don't see the point of much anymore. Even at work, I'm going through the motions. Everything feels empty.

Therapist: That feeling like grief is a black hole can be overwhelming. What does that black hole feel like - is it a sense of numbness, a heavy weight, or something else - and how does it affect your daily interactions, like at work, where you feel like you're just going through the motions?

Patient: It's heavy. Like wading through thick mud, every step is an effort. I snap at people more than I used to. I can see it on their faces, they notice the difference. I just want to be left alone most of the time.

Therapist: That feeling like you're wading through mud can be incredibly draining. When you snap at people, what are you hoping to achieve in that moment - are you trying to push them away, protect yourself, or something else?

Patient: I don't know what I'm trying to do. I just want them to leave me be. I don't have the patience for them anymore. It's like every little thing sets me off. I don't mean to be so harsh, but I can't help it. I can't deal with their problems right now.

Therapist: That sense of not having the patience for others can be really isolating. What do you think you're trying to protect yourself from - is it the pain of their problems, the feeling of being overwhelmed, or something else - that's making you want to push them away and not deal with it right now?

Patient: I just can't take on anyone else's stuff right now. I'm drowning in my own problems. It's like I can't breathe.

Therapist: That feeling of drowning can be terrifying. What does it mean to you to be able to breathe - is it having space, having control, or something else - and what's missing right now that's making you feel like you're suffocating under your own problems?

Patient: It's just too much. Too much pain, too much to deal with. I can't handle it all. I need space, I need quiet. I need to not have to worry about everyone else for once. It's like I'm being pulled in a thousand different directions, I can't keep up.

Therapist: That feeling of being pulled in a thousand different directions can be incredibly overwhelming. What do you hope to find or achieve when you have space and quiet - is it a sense of clarity, a chance to recharge, or something else - that you're not getting in the midst of all this chaos?

Patient: I just want peace. A chance to think. A chance to not have to be strong for everyone else. I just want to be left alone for a while.

Therapist: That sense of wanting to be left alone and have peace can be a really important message. What does it mean to you to be strong for others - is it about being their rock, providing for them, or something else - and what are you afraid will happen if you're not able to be that for them right now?

Patient: It means not showing weakness. Not letting them see how much I'm struggling. I'm afraid if I show how much I'm hurting, it'll make it real. And I can't go there yet. I can't handle that. Not with everything else going on.

Therapist: That fear of showing weakness can be a heavy burden to carry. What if, instead of hiding your pain, you allowed yourself to be vulnerable with those around you - what do you think might happen, and is that something you're willing to consider as a possibility?

Patient: I don't know if I can do that. I don't know what would happen. I don't want to fall apart in front of them. I don't want them to see me like that. I guess I'm just not ready to go there yet. I need more time.

Therapist: That need for time can be a reasonable request. What do you hope to achieve by taking more time before being more open with others - is it a sense of control, a better understanding of your emotions, or something else - and what are you afraid will happen if you do start to be more vulnerable now?

Patient: I just want to feel more steady. More sure of myself. I'm afraid if I open up now, I'll just crumble. And I can't have that. I can't put that on anyone else right now. I need to know I can handle it before I let anyone else in.

Therapist: That need for stability can be a strong motivator. What does it mean to you to feel steady and sure of yourself - is it about having a sense of control, being able to make decisions, or something else - and what are you trying to prove to yourself or others by needing to feel that way?

Patient: It's about not feeling like I'm flailing. Like I have some sort of control over my life. I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone. I just want to feel like I can stand on my own two feet again. I hate feeling like I'm just being tossed around by all of this.

Therapist: That feeling of being tossed around can be incredibly disorienting. What does it mean to stand on your own two feet - is it about making decisions, taking care of yourself, or something else - and what are you afraid will happen if you don't feel like you can do that, especially in your relationships with others?

Patient: It means being independent. Not having to rely on anyone else. I'm afraid if I can't stand on my own, I'll be a burden. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I've seen what that does to people. I don't want that. Not for me, not for them.

Therapist: That fear of being a burden can be a powerful motivator. What did you learn from seeing others as burdens, and how has that shaped your own approach to asking for help or accepting support from others - are you trying to avoid being seen as a burden, or is there something else at play?

Patient: I learned that people get tired of it. They get tired of you. I don't want that. I don't want people to get tired of me. So I just deal with things on my own. Always have. I don't like asking for help. It makes me feel weak.

Therapist: That fear of being seen as weak can be a heavy weight to carry. What does it mean to you to feel weak - is it about not being able to take care of yourself, not being capable, or something else - and how has that definition of weakness impacted your relationships and your willingness to ask for help?
