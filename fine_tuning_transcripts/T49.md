# Transcript T49

Patient: I've been having a tough time lately with work. I'm constantly worried about my performance as a construction worker, and it's getting in the way. I find myself putting things off, procrastinating, and it's just making everything worse. I don't know how to get out of this cycle.

Therapist: What is it about your performance as a construction worker that you're worried about, specifically?

Patient: I keep thinking I'm too slow, or that I'll make a mistake that'll cost the team. There are these younger guys at work, and I feel like I can't keep up with them. Like I'm becoming obsolete, I guess. It's not like anyone's said anything, but I can't shake the feeling.

Therapist: What does the idea of becoming obsolete mean to you, exactly? What's the worst that could happen if you don't keep up with the younger guys?

Patient: Well, if I can't keep up, then I figure they'll probably replace me with someone who can. Someone younger, faster. Then I'd be out of a job, and I'm not sure what I'd do then. I've been a construction worker for most of my life, it's all I know. It's not like there are many jobs out there for an old guy like me. I need to work to keep up with my expenses and I don't feel ready to retire.

Therapist: What does working as a construction worker mean to you beyond just a job? What kind of life and contributions to your community do you want to continue making even if you're not doing this work anymore?

Patient: I take a lot of pride in my work. It's not just a job, it's who I am. I've always liked building things, seeing something real and solid at the end of the day. It's hard work, but it's honest, you know? As for the community, I'm not sure I contribute much, but I like to think that what I build, it matters. I help build homes, schools, places where people live and work. I'd like to think that even if I'm not doing this anymore, I'd still be doing something useful. Something that matters. But it's hard to imagine what that would be. I'm not much of a people person, so I don't see myself volunteering or anything like that.

Therapist: What does it mean to you to live a meaningful life, not in terms of a specific job, but in terms of how you spend your time and energy?

Patient: I guess a meaningful life for me would be one where I feel useful, where I'm doing something that has a purpose. Like I said, I'm not much of a people person, so I don't need to be out there changing the world or anything. But I think if I can spend my time and energy on something that has some kind of positive impact, even if it's small, that's meaningful to me. I just want to feel like I'm contributing, not just taking up space. But honestly, I've been doing this job for so long, it's hard to imagine what else I could be doing.

Therapist: What does it mean to you to be "taking up space"? What's the opposite of that, in terms of how you want to feel in your life?

Patient: To me, "taking up space" means just being here, not really doing anything worthwhile. Like I'm just a burden, not contributing anything. I guess the opposite of that would be feeling like I have a purpose. Like I'm doing something that matters, even if it's just to me. I want to feel like I'm earning my keep, so to speak. Like I deserve to be here because I'm doing something worthwhile with my life.

Therapist: How might you be using your desire to "earn your keep" and feel like you're deserving of being here to motivate yourself to take action in your current situation, like at work?

Patient: I dunno, it's not like I can just tell myself to stop worrying and start working harder. I've tried that. I guess maybe I could start by setting some small goals for myself at work. Things I know I can do, but maybe I've been putting them off. Maybe if I can start checking things off a list, I'd feel like I'm doing something worthwhile again. But it's hard to know where to start, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed.

Therapist: What's one task at work that you've been putting off, and if you were to just do it today, what would that look like?

Patient: Lately I've been putting off checking the site inventory. It's not a huge task, but it's important. If I were to just do it today, I guess I'd start by checking each item off the list, making sure everything is accounted for and in good condition. It would probably take me a couple of hours to finish. But I keep thinking about how much easier it would be for someone younger, faster. I guess that's been one of the things holding me back.

Therapist: What would happen if, instead of thinking about what others might be doing, you focused on the feeling of checking off each item on that list, one by one, as you complete it?

Patient: I suppose I'd feel a bit more in control, more focused. I might even feel a sense of accomplishment, instead of just being stuck in my head, worrying about what others are doing or thinking.

Therapist: Let's try an experiment. Take a few deep breaths, and when you're ready, I want you to start checking off those items on the list, one by one. Focus on the task itself, not on what others might think or what you might be worried about. Just you, the task, and the feeling of accomplishment as you complete each one.

Patient: Alright, I'm game. Let me take a moment.

Okay, I'm back. I can see the list in front of me. Let's get going.

Therapist: You've started checking off the items on the list, one by one. What's the first thing you're going to do, and what do you notice about your experience as you begin?

Patient: First thing I'm doing is counting up the safety gear. I notice that I'm not rushing. I'm taking my time, making sure everything is accounted for. I feel a bit more focused already, which is good because I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. It's better than just sitting around worrying, to be honest. It feels good to be doing something productive.

Therapist: As you're taking care of this task, remember what you said earlier about wanting to feel useful and make a positive impact. How does this task fit into that, and what does it mean to you to be using your time and energy in this way?

Patient: Well, I guess checking the inventory is important for safety and for keeping the job running smoothly. If we run out of something or if it's damaged, it could cause delays, or worse, accidents. So, in a way, I am making a positive impact by ensuring everything is in order. I had not thought of it like that.

Therapist: Now that you see this task as making a positive impact, what does that mean to you in terms of your sense of identity and worth? How does it feel to know that you're contributing to the safety and success of the job?

Patient: I guess it makes me feel like I'm still valuable, still have something to offer. It's a good reminder that my experience and attention to detail can make a difference. It's not just about keeping up with the younger guys, it's about what I bring to the table. It feels reassuring, I suppose. Like I'm not just taking up space, I'm contributing.

Therapist: How might you carry this sense of value and contribution with you into your daily work, not just when you're checking the inventory, but in all the tasks and challenges that come your way?

Patient: I'm not sure, really. It's easy to say "just keep this feeling," but when I'm out there and things start to get tough, or someone's watching, I start to doubt myself. But maybe, just maybe, I can try to remember that every task matters.

Therapist: What would it take for you to remember that every task matters, especially when things get tough or you're feeling judged? Is there something specific you could do, or a phrase you could tell yourself, to help you stay connected to this sense of value and contribution?

Patient: Maybe I could have a sort of mantra, something like "Every task matters, and I'm the one making it happen." I don't know if that'll work, but it's worth a shot. I could write it down somewhere I can see it, like on my hard hat or something. Might feel silly, but if it helps...

Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. Writing it down and putting it somewhere visible can be a powerful way to reinforce a new habit or mindset. Remember, it's not about the words themselves, but what they represent: your commitment to taking care of yourself and your work.

Patient: Yeah, I get that. I'll give it a try. But I'm not promising anything. I just hope it doesn't look too silly. It's better than being stuck in my head, worried about what others think.

Therapist: That's exactly the right approach. It's not about trying to change how others see you, but about how you see yourself and your work. And it's okay if it feels a little silly at first – it's a small price to pay for taking care of yourself and your well-being.

Patient: I suppose that's true. Alright, I'll give it a shot. But I'm not making any big promises. I just hope it helps.

Therapist: It was great working with you today. Remember, it's not about achieving some specific outcome, but about taking care of yourself and your values. If you want to schedule another session in the future, we can continue to work on implementing this new approach and seeing how it goes.

Patient: Alright, thanks. I'll think about it. It's not like this is gonna solve everything, but it's a start, I guess. I'll see how it goes.

Therapist: That's exactly right. It's a start, and every step forward is a step in the right direction. I'll be here if you want to continue working on this. Take care of yourself.

Patient: Yeah, okay. I'll keep that in mind. You too.

Therapist: Take care, and have a good day.

Patient: You too.

Therapist: The session has concluded.
