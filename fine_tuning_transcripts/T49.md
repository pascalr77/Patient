# Transcript T49

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really stuck in this cycle of beating myself up. I come from a high-achieving family and I've always felt this pressure to succeed. But recently, I've been feeling like I'm not measuring up, and I just can't shake this constant self-criticism. It's been really tough.

Therapist: That pressure to live up to family expectations can be overwhelming. What does 'measuring up' look like to you, in terms of specific achievements or qualities that you think you need to have to meet your family's standards?

Patient: Well, in my family, success is pretty much defined by your career. It's all about titles, salaries, and how fast you're moving up the ladder. My parents always made it clear that they expect me to be at the top, you know? So, I guess 'measuring up' means having a high-status job, making a lot of money, and basically being the best at what I do. But lately, I've been feeling like I'm falling behind in all those areas. It's like, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to live up to those expectations.

Therapist: That sounds like a lot of pressure. What do you think would happen if you were to let go of the idea of meeting your family's expectations around career success? What would be more important to you in your life, if you didn't have to live up to those standards?

Patient: Honestly, I don't know what would happen if I let go of that pressure. I mean, it's been there for as long as I can remember. If I didn't have to live up to those standards... I guess I'd want to find something I truly enjoy doing. Maybe I'd focus more on my hobbies, like painting or something. But it's hard to even imagine that. It feels like I'd be letting everyone down, you know? Like I'd be a failure or something.

Therapist: That fear of disappointing others can be really paralyzing. What do you think you would gain or lose if you were to act on your desire to pursue painting, even if it wasn't a high-paying job or a way to impress your family?

Patient: If I pursued painting, I think I'd gain some happiness, you know? Like, I like my job as a data scientist, but it's not my passion. Painting is something I do for me, not for anyone else's approval. But, I'd probably lose that sense of security that comes with having a 'respectable' career. And I'd have to deal with the disapproval from my family. I don't know if I'm ready for that. It's a lot to think about.

Therapist: The desire for security and family approval seems to be a significant motivator for your self-criticism. What do you think is the worst that would happen if you lost that sense of security and your family didn't approve of your choices?

Patient: If I lost that sense of security and my family didn't approve, I guess the worst that could happen is that I'd be letting them down. I'd have to deal with their disappointment, and that's a hard feeling to face. Plus, I'd be taking a big risk, you know? Like, what if I fail? What if I can't make it work and I end up regretting it? Then I'd be stuck with that failure, and it would be even harder to face my family. It's scary to think about.

Therapist: The fear of failure and regret seems to be a major obstacle. What if, instead of focusing on avoiding those outcomes, you were to approach this decision as an experiment, where you're testing out a new path and learning from the experience, regardless of the outcome?

Patient: An experiment? That's an interesting way to think about it. So, like, instead of seeing it as a pass/fail situation, I'd be trying it out to see what happens? I guess that takes some of the pressure off, but it's still kind of scary. I mean, what if the experiment goes wrong? What if I don't like where the path leads me? I don't know if I can just brush that off as a learning experience. But I do see what you're getting at. It's just... it's hard to shift my mindset like that.

Therapist: What would it take for you to feel more comfortable with the idea of this being an experiment, rather than a high-stakes decision? Is there something specific that's making it hard for you to let go of the need for a clear, predetermined outcome?

Patient: I think I'd feel more comfortable with the experiment idea if I had some kind of safety net, you know? Like, if I knew I could go back to my current job if it didn't work out. But that's not really realistic. I think what's holding me back is this need for certainty. I like having a clear plan, clear goals. The idea of putting myself out there and not knowing what will happen is really unsettling for me. It's like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, and I can't see what's at the bottom. It's just a big leap into the unknown, and that's terrifying.

Therapist: The image of standing on a cliff is really vivid. What do you think would happen if you were to take the leap, and instead of looking down, you were to focus on the present moment, on the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your face, and the sensation of your breath in your body?

Patient: If I were to take the leap and focus on the present, I guess I'd feel more in control. Like, instead of being overwhelmed by the unknown, I'd be grounded in what's happening right now. I'd notice all those sensations, the ground, the air, my breath. Maybe it would make the whole thing less scary. But it's still hard to wrap my head around. It's like my mind is always racing to the next thing, the what-ifs. It's not easy to just be present. But I think I see what you're getting at. It's worth a try, I guess.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is always trying to prepare for the next step, to solve the next problem, to avoid uncertainty. What if, instead of trying to control the future, you were to let go of the need to know what's coming next, and instead, focus on what you can control, which is your actions in this present moment?

Patient: Easier said than done, right? Letting go of that control is tough. I mean, I get it, logically. Focus on what I can control, stay present, all that. But it's the actual doing it that's hard. It's like my mind is on autopilot, always trying to figure out the next ten steps. I guess I could try to be more aware of when it's doing that. Maybe catch myself in the moment and try to refocus. But it's not like I can just flip a switch and suddenly I'm all zen and present. It's gonna take some work.

Therapist: You're right, it's not about flipping a switch. What would it take for you to commit to making this change, to practicing being more present and aware of your thoughts, rather than just acknowledging it as a good idea?

Patient: I think I need something concrete to hold me accountable. Like a specific goal, or a plan. Just saying "I'll try to be more present" isn't enough for me. Maybe if I set aside a specific time each day to practice, like a mindfulness exercise or something. Or maybe I could start by just checking in with myself a few times a day, seeing where my mind is at. I need something structured, otherwise it's too easy to just let it slide. But I'm not sure exactly what that should look like. I guess I need help figuring that out.

Therapist: That's a great starting point. Let's explore what a daily check-in could look like for you. Would you be more likely to commit to checking in with yourself at the same time every day, like first thing in the morning or right before bed, or would you prefer to do it at different times depending on your schedule?

Patient: I think having a set time would be better for me. Like first thing in the morning. That way it becomes part of my routine, and I'm less likely to blow it off. If I leave it open, I know I'll find excuses to put it off. Plus, starting the day with a check-in sounds kind of nice, you know? Like, get my head on straight before I dive into everything else. But I'm not sure exactly what I should be doing during that check-in. What should I be looking for or paying attention to?

Therapist: When you're checking in with yourself in the morning, what if you simply asked yourself, "What's the first thought that comes to mind when I wake up?" or "What's the first thing that's on my mind?" and just observe it without judgment, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Okay, I can do that. Just ask myself what's first on my mind and observe it. But what then? Do I just sit with it? Or should I be trying to analyze it or something? I feel like I need more to go on than just observing. What's the point if I'm not doing anything with that observation?

Therapist: The point of the morning check-in isn't to analyze or try to fix the thought, but to simply become aware of it. By observing your first thought without judgment, you're taking a small step towards being more present and aware of your mind. What if, instead of trying to do anything with the thought, you simply acknowledged it and then took a few deep breaths, noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Alright, I think I get it. So, I ask myself what's on my mind, acknowledge the thought, and then move on to focusing on my breath. I can give that a try. It feels a bit strange, I won't lie. Like, it's so simple, but it's not easy, you know? I'm used to overthinking everything, so just acknowledging and moving on is gonna take some practice. But I'll try it. How many times should I do the deep breaths thing? Is there a specific number, or do I just do it until I feel ready to move on?

Therapist: There's no specific number of deep breaths you need to take, just do what feels natural. You can breathe deeply until you feel a sense of calm or clarity, or until you feel like you're ready to move on with your day. You can also experiment with a simple phrase, like "exhale tension, inhale clarity," to help you stay focused on your breath. The goal is to make this a gentle, grounding ritual that helps you start your day on a calm note.

Patient: Okay, I'll try that. Just breathe until it feels right. I like the phrase idea too. It's something concrete to focus on. So, I'll ask what's on my mind, acknowledge it, then breathe and use the phrase. I think I can handle that. It's still feels a bit weird, but I'll give it a shot. What if nothing comes to mind? Or what if it's something really dumb, like what I want for breakfast? Should I still just acknowledge it and move on?

Therapist: Even if nothing comes to mind or if it's something seemingly insignificant, like what you want for breakfast, the practice is still valuable. You're training yourself to be present and aware of your thoughts, even the small ones. So, yes, still acknowledge it, breathe, and use the phrase. It's not about the content of the thought, but about the process of observing it and letting it go.

Patient: Alright, that makes sense. It's the process that matters, not the thought itself. I'll give it a shot. So, I guess I'll start tomorrow morning. Just ask, acknowledge, breathe, and use the phrase. I can do that. It feels a bit weird to start, but I guess that's normal. I'll see how it goes. Thanks for explaining it that way, it helps.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember, the goal is not to get it right or wrong, but to show up and be present. Be kind to yourself as you start this new practice, and don't worry if it feels awkward or if your mind wanders. That's all part of the process. Just show up, breathe, and be gentle with yourself.

Patient: Yeah, you're right. I need to cut myself some slack. It's not about being perfect, it's about just doing it. I can be pretty hard on myself sometimes, so I'll try to keep that in mind. Just show up, breathe, and be kind to myself. Easier said than done, but I'll give it my best shot. Thanks for the reminder. I think I needed that.

Therapist: It's great that you're recognizing the importance of being kind to yourself. What if, in addition to showing up, breathing, and using the phrase, you also remind yourself of why you're doing this practice? What values or goals do you hope to achieve by being more present and aware?

Patient: I guess I'm doing this because I want some peace of mind, you know? I'm tired of always feeling like I'm not good enough, like I'm falling behind. I want to be more present so I can enjoy what's happening right now, instead of always worrying about what's next. I think it would make me happier, less anxious. Plus, maybe it would help me actually enjoy painting again, instead of feeling like it's just another thing I have to be the best at. So, I guess that's my goal. Some peace, some happiness.

Therapist: That's a beautiful goal. Having a clear sense of what you're working towards can be really powerful. What if, each time you do your morning check-in, you also take a moment to remind yourself of this goal, and what it means to you? Maybe even write it down and post it somewhere visible, as a reminder of why you're showing up to your day with kindness and awareness?

Patient: I like that idea. Writing it down would make it feel more real, I think. Like, I can't just ignore it or brush it off if it's right there in front of me. I could put it on my mirror or something, so I see it every morning. That way I'd be reminded of why I'm doing this, and maybe it would help me stay motivated. It's worth a shot. I'll give it a try.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Writing it down and putting it somewhere visible will make it harder to ignore and more likely to stay top of mind. Remember, it's not just about the physical act of writing it down, but about making it a part of who you are and what you stand for. So, when you see it every morning, don't just read the words, connect with the feeling behind them, and let that guide you through your day.

Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. I'll try to connect with the feeling. It's not just about the words, it's about what they mean to me. I'll give it a shot. It feels a bit cheesy, but I think it could help. We'll see how it goes. Thanks for the suggestion. I wouldn't have thought of that on my own.

Therapist: It's not cheesy at all, it's a powerful way to connect with your values and stay motivated. I'm glad I could help. It was great talking with you, and I'm looking forward to hearing how you progress with your practice. Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.

Patient: Yeah, okay. One step at a time. I can do that. We'll see how it goes tomorrow, I guess. Thanks for talking with me. It was helpful. I'll do my best to stick with it and see where it takes me. Catch you later.

Therapist: It was great talking with you too. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need to talk again. Good luck with your practice, and I'll catch you later.
