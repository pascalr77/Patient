# Transcript T7

Patient: I've been having a tough time lately. I recently moved away from my family and friends, and I find myself being too hard on myself about it. I feel like I should be handling this better, but the truth is, I'm struggling. It's been a big change and I just can't seem to shake off this feeling.

Therapist: That self-criticism can be a heavy burden to carry, especially when you're already adjusting to a big change. What do you think you're trying to achieve when you're being hard on yourself about handling this transition?

Patient: I don't know really. I guess I think if I'm hard on myself, it'll push me to do better, to adjust faster. I just don't want to feel like I'm failing at this too, you know? But lately, it's been feeling like it's doing more harm than good.

Therapist: It sounds like being hard on yourself isn't actually helping you adjust faster, but it's still a familiar pattern. What's more important to you in this transition – being able to adjust quickly, or being kind to yourself as you navigate this new chapter in your life?

Patient: I never really thought about it that way. I guess I've always just wanted to be able to adapt quickly, not be a burden to anyone. But now that you mention it, maybe I should focus on being kind to myself. It's just not as easy as it sounds, you know? I'm not sure I know how.

Therapist: That's a really important value of yours, wanting to be a burden to no one. Being kind to yourself in the midst of a big change might mean being gentle with your struggles, rather than pushing yourself to be someone you're not. What would it look like for you to be kind to yourself right now, in this moment, when you're feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I'm not sure, really. I guess maybe just acknowledging that this is tough? That it's okay to not have it all together right now? It's just so hard to not feel like I'm failing when I'm not just breezing through this. I don't want people to worry about me, but I also don't want to feel like this anymore. It's all so confusing.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a part of you that's worried about being a burden, but another part of you is tired of carrying this weight alone. What if, instead of trying to hide how tough this is, you allowed yourself to feel and express it to those around you, even if it means they might worry a bit? What might happen if you gave yourself permission to be vulnerable and authentic in this moment?

Patient: I don't know what would happen, honestly. I guess I just don't want people to think I'm weak or not capable. But it's just so hard to keep it all inside. I'm tired of feeling like I have to put on a brave face all the time. Maybe if I let someone in, just a little bit, it might help.

Therapist: That makes sense – it's a big fear to have. But what if people's reactions to your vulnerability aren't about judging you as weak, but about showing up for you in a supportive way? If you were to let someone in, just a little bit, what would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take to start being more authentic and open with them?

Patient: I guess maybe I could start by just telling someone I'm having a hard time. Not go into all the details, just admit that I'm struggling a bit. I think that might be a good first step, something small I can handle. I just don't know who to talk to, really. I'm still new here and I don't want to worry my family back home.

Therapist: That's a great first step, being willing to admit you're struggling. As for who to talk to, what if you considered reaching out to a trusted family member, not to burden them, but to let them know you're navigating a tough time and value their support? What might be the benefit of being honest with them about how you're feeling, even if it's just a little bit?

Patient: I guess if I talk to them, they might understand why I've been so distant. Maybe it would even bring us closer. I just don't want them to worry too much about me. But at the same time, I do miss talking to them, sharing my life with them. It's just hard to know what to say, how much to share.

Therapist: It sounds like you miss the connection with your family, and you're not sure how to bridge the distance. What if, instead of trying to shield them from your struggles, you saw this as an opportunity to deepen your relationship by being more open and honest with them? What would it mean to you to feel more connected to them, even from a distance?

Patient: I think it would mean a lot. It's just hard when I feel like I should be strong, that I should be handling this better. But maybe you're right, maybe opening up would be good for all of us. I just don't know where to start, really. It's all so overwhelming. I guess I could maybe just start by telling them I miss them, that I'm having a tough time being away from them. That feels true and not too scary to say.

Therapist: That feels like a really good place to start – acknowledging your feelings and letting them know you miss them. What if, by sharing this with them, you opened the door to a more honest and authentic conversation, not just about your struggles, but about your love and connection with each other? What might happen if you took a deep breath and sent that message, or even just started a conversation about how you're feeling?

Patient: Maybe they'd understand better why I've been so quiet lately. Maybe it would bring us closer, even with the distance. I'm still not sure it's the right thing to do, but I guess it couldn't hurt to just send a quick message, see how it feels. It's just so hard to know what to say, how much to share. I don't want to make a big deal out of it, you know? I just want to feel like me again.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a sense of authenticity and connection with yourself and your loved ones. What if, by being a little more open and honest, you were able to tap into that sense of self and feel more like yourself, even in the midst of a tough time?

Patient: I guess that's true. I just don't want to be seen differently, you know? But maybe, if I'm honest, I'll feel more like me. It's worth a shot, I suppose. I just need to find the right words, the right way to say it. I don't want to make a big fuss, just want to be real. It's hard, but I think you might be right.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to express yourself that feels true to who you are, without putting on a show or making a big fuss. Can you try writing a message that's just a simple expression of your feelings, without worrying about how it'll be received? What if you just said something like, "Hey, I'm missing you guys and it's tough being away. I love you and I'm thinking of you"?

Patient: Alright, here it goes. "Hey, just wanted to say I miss you all. It's been a bit tough over here, but I'm thinking of you and love you lots." That feels okay, not too much, not too little. Maybe that's a good place to start, see how it feels.

Therapist: That sounds like a great place to start. What are you hoping will happen when you send this message? What do you think you might get out of being more open and honest with your family, even if it's just a small step like this?

Patient: I guess I hope they'll just understand where I'm coming from, why I've been quiet. I think maybe it'll help me feel more connected to them, even though I'm far away. I don't expect anything big, just maybe a little more understanding, a little more closeness. That would be nice. We'll see, I guess. I'm still a bit nervous, but I think it's worth a shot.

Therapist: That's a beautiful hope – wanting to feel more connected to your family, even from a distance. What if, by being honest and open with them, you're not just looking for their understanding, but also for a deeper connection within yourself? What if this small act of vulnerability is a step towards feeling more whole and at peace, no matter what happens next?

Patient: I never really thought of it that way. I guess maybe it could be a step towards feeling more like me again. I just hope it goes over alright, that they won't worry too much. But I think, no matter what, it's good for me to be honest, to not just keep it all inside. Even if it's a little scary, it's worth trying, right?

Therapist: That's a huge step forward – recognizing the value of honesty and vulnerability for yourself, even if it's a little scary. What if, regardless of what happens next, you allow yourself to be kind and compassionate towards yourself for taking this step? What if you acknowledge that it's okay to be scared, and that you're doing the best you can?

Patient: Okay, I can try that. It's just hard to not be tough on myself, you know? But I do get what you're saying. I should be proud of myself for facing this, for trying. Baby steps, right? It's just all so new to me, so different. But I'll try, I'll really try to be kinder to myself. Thank you, I needed to hear that.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have – recognizing that growth and progress are about taking small steps, not about being perfect. Remember, being kind to yourself is not about being weak, but about being strong and resilient. What if, from now on, you focus on treating yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you would offer to a close friend?

Patient: Easier said than done, but I see your point. It's funny how we can be so hard on ourselves but still be kind to others. I'll give it a shot, try to be a friend to myself, so to speak. Like I said, no promises, but I'll try. It's just gonna take some time, that's all.

Therapist: That's a great commitment to make – being a friend to yourself. Remember, it's okay if it takes time, and it's okay if you stumble along the way. What if you give yourself permission to be patient and gentle with yourself as you learn to be kinder, rather than beating yourself up for not being perfect?

Patient: Yeah, okay. Permission granted, I guess. It's just weird, you know? Being nice to myself feels almost selfish, but I know that's not right. I'll work on it, really I will. Just need to keep reminding myself it's okay to not be perfect all the time. That's all.

Therapist: It's a big shift to make, but it's not selfish to take care of yourself. What if, by being kind to yourself, you're actually becoming a more whole and compassionate person, someone who can show up for others in a more meaningful way?

Patient: Never really thought of it like that, but it makes sense. I guess if I'm not so run down all the time, I'd have more to give, more to offer. It's just, well, it's just so different from what I'm used to. But you're right, I think. I should give it a shot, see what happens. What have I got to lose anyway? Nothing, that's what.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have – nothing to lose and everything to gain. What if you take a deep breath and commit to being kind to yourself from now on, not just because it's good for you, but because it's a fundamental part of who you are?

Patient: Easier said than done, but okay, I'm in. I'll do my best, that's all I can promise. I just hope it gets easier, you know? Feels a bit weird right now, but I'll keep at it. Like I said, nothing to lose. Might as well give it my best shot.

Therapist: That's a great promise to make – to do your best. And remember, it's okay if it doesn't get easier right away. What if, instead of focusing on how weird it feels, you focus on the fact that you're taking a brave and courageous step towards being kinder to yourself?

Patient: I guess that's true. I am trying, aren't I? Okay, yeah, I can do that. I can be brave, I can do this. One step at a time, like you said. I just gotta keep reminding myself, it's okay to be me, to feel how I feel. I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough for now.

Therapist: That's a beautiful place to be – recognizing that you're doing the best you can and that's enough. What if, from now on, you continue to be kind to yourself, not just because it's a new habit, but because it's a reflection of your growing self-awareness and self-love?

Patient: I guess that makes sense. I am growing, aren't I? It's not perfect, but it's progress. I just gotta keep going, keep trying. I can do that, I think.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have – acknowledging progress and being willing to continue growing. What if you take a moment to celebrate your small wins, your tiny steps forward? What if you acknowledge that you're a work in progress, and that's okay?
