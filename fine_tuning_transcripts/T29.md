# Transcript T29

Patient: I've been feeling a bit lost lately. I've been a nurse for decades, and it's been my whole life, but now that the kids are gone, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do with myself outside of work. It's like I'm just going through the motions, but nothing seems to really matter anymore.

Therapist: It sounds like this transition is really tough for you, and it's understandable that you'd feel lost without the kids at home. What are some things you used to enjoy doing with your kids that you haven't had the chance to do lately, or would like to start doing now that they're more independent?

Patient: I used to love cooking with them, but now it's just me, it doesn't seem worth the effort. I miss those days, but I don't know, it's not the same just cooking for one. I'm not even sure what I enjoy anymore, it's all a bit of a blur.

Therapist: You used to find joy in cooking with your kids, and now it feels like a different experience. What do you think it was about cooking with your kids that brought you happiness, and is there anything you can think of that you'd like to replace or add to your current routine that might capture some of that same feeling?

Patient: I suppose it was the company, the chatting, the teaching them something new. It wasn't just about the food, it was the whole experience. Now, I don't know, it's just silent, lonely. I'm not sure what I could do to fill that, I'm not even sure I have the energy to figure it out.

Therapist: It sounds like the loneliness of cooking alone is really getting to you. What's one thing that's most important to you right now, something that would give you a sense of purpose and direction, even if it's just a small step?

Patient: I guess I just want to feel useful, like I have a purpose beyond just going to work and coming home to an empty house. I don't know how to make that happen, but I wish I could find something that makes me feel needed again.

Therapist: You mention feeling needed, which is a really important part of your identity as a nurse and a mother. What do you think you could do in your community or with your work that would make a positive impact on others, even if it's just a small thing, that would help you feel like you're still making a difference?

Patient: I'm not sure, I've been so focused on my own world that I haven't really thought about what else is out there. I guess I could look into volunteering somewhere, but I'm not even sure where to start. I've always been so busy with the kids and work, this is all new to me.

Therapist: It's a big change to start looking for ways to make a difference beyond your immediate family and work. What are some small steps you could take to start exploring volunteering, like researching local organizations or talking to friends who are involved in something they care about, that would feel like a good starting point for you?

Patient: I suppose I could start by looking online, see what's out there. I have a friend who volunteers at the local library, maybe I could ask her about it. I don't want to commit to anything big right away, just something to get me out of the house and feeling useful again.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan to start small and get a feel for what volunteering might be like for you. What do you think it would take for you to feel like you're making progress towards feeling useful again, something that would give you a sense of momentum and motivation to keep moving forward?

Patient: I think if I could just find one thing to do, even if it's small, like helping out at the library for an hour a week, that would be a start. I don't want to get overwhelmed, but I need something to look forward to, something that gives me a reason to get up in the morning. I just want to feel like I'm making a difference again, no matter how small.

Therapist: That's a great sense of clarity around what you're looking for - something small that gives you a reason to get up in the morning. What do you think would happen if you were to start showing up to the library for that hour a week, not necessarily to achieve some grand outcome, but just to be there and contribute in some small way - what might that be like for you?

Patient: I suppose it would give me some structure, a reason to get out of the house. I might even meet some new people, who knows. I just don't want to feel like I'm wasting my time, like I'm not making a difference. I guess I won't know until I try.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have, being willing to try something new and see what happens. What if, instead of focusing on making a big difference, you were to approach this experience with the mindset that it's okay to show up, be present, and see what unfolds, without needing to know exactly what the outcome will be?

Patient: Easier said than done. I've always been the kind of person who needs to know what's coming, but I suppose I could try. It's just hard to not have expectations, you know? But I'll think about it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step just by considering this idea. What if you were to approach your time at the library not as a means to a specific end, but as an end in itself - as a way to simply be present and engage with the world around you, without needing to know what's going to happen or how it's going to turn out?

Patient: I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Are you saying I should just go and not worry about what happens? That's not really how I operate. I like to have a plan, a purpose. But I'll think about what you've said.

Therapist: I'm not saying you should go without a plan, but rather that you might consider what's driving your need for a plan. What if your purpose isn't necessarily something you can plan for, but rather something that arises from being present and engaged in the moment - like helping someone at the library, or simply being there for others?

Patient: I'm not sure I buy that. I've always had a plan, a goal. It's hard to just let that go. But I'll think about it.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that things might not be the same way they've always been. What if, instead of trying to change who you are, you were to explore what it would be like to see yourself as a person who can show up, be present, and make a difference in the world, regardless of whether you have a plan or not?

Patient: I said I'd think about it, but I can't just flip a switch and be someone I'm not. I've always had a plan, it's who I am. I can't just change that overnight. I'll think about what you've said, but I can't promise anything.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty and commitment to being true to yourself. It's not about flipping a switch or trying to be someone you're not, but rather about exploring the possibility of adding new dimensions to who you are, while still being the person you've always been. What if you were to see your willingness to consider new ideas and perspectives as a way of deepening and enriching your existing identity, rather than trying to change who you are?

Patient: Maybe. I'm just not sure how to do that, to be honest. It's all a bit confusing. I just want to feel like I have a purpose again. I guess you're saying it's possible, I just don't know how.

Therapist: It's okay to feel confused, and it's okay to not have all the answers. What if, instead of trying to figure out how to find your purpose all at once, you were to take small, tiny steps towards it - like scheduling that hour a week at the library, or reaching out to your friend about volunteering - and see where it takes you?

Patient: I suppose I could do that.

Therapist: That's a great starting point. What's the first small step you could take towards that hour a week at the library, something as simple as making a phone call or sending an email to your friend?

Patient: I guess I could send my friend a message, just to ask her about it. No promises though, I need to think about it some more.

Therapist: That's a great first step. What if you were to approach sending that message not as a commitment to volunteering, but as a way of gathering information and exploring possibilities, with no pressure or expectation of what might come of it?

Patient: Maybe. I'll think about it. I just don't want to feel forced into anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to move forward that feels authentic and voluntary to you. What if you were to think of this process as an invitation, rather than an obligation, and see what arises when you approach it with a sense of curiosity and openness?

Patient: I said I'll think about it. I just need some time. I'm not sure what I want right now.

Therapist: It's completely okay to take the time you need to figure things out. In fact, it's essential to give yourself the space to explore and reflect on what you want and need. What if you were to give yourself permission to not have all the answers right now, and instead, focus on showing up to your own process with kindness and compassion?

Patient: Easier said than done. I've never been very good at being kind to myself. I'll try, but no promises.

Therapist: It's not about being perfect or making promises, but rather about taking small steps towards being kinder to yourself. What if you were to start by acknowledging one thing you appreciate about yourself today, no matter how small it may seem?

Patient: I don't know. I'm not really comfortable with all this self-reflection stuff. It's not really my thing.

Therapist: That's okay. It's not everyone's cup of tea. What if you were to view this process as a way of getting to know yourself better, rather than as self-reflection?

Patient: I suppose that's a bit different. I just don't want to feel like I'm sitting around thinking about myself all day. I'm not sure what the point of that is.

Therapist: It's understandable that you want to feel like you're using your time effectively. What if you were to think of this process as a way of getting clear on what's most important to you, so you can use your time and energy more intentionally and effectively?
