# Transcript T19

Patient: Hi there, it's been a tough few months. I've been feeling really stuck, like I'm just going through the motions with my work and nothing else matters. Since my breakup, I just can't shake this feeling of being lost, like I don't know what I want anymore. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest.

Therapist: That feeling of just going through the motions sounds really draining. When you say you're doing that at work, what does it mean specifically? Are there tasks or activities that you used to enjoy but now feel like a chore?

Patient: Well, I've been a social worker for decades, and I used to have so much passion for it. But now, it feels like I'm just ticking boxes, even when I'm helping people. It's like the spark is gone. I used to love visiting with clients, planning community events, but now... it's all just stuff I have to do and there's no 'want' in it.

Therapist: It sounds like the passion for your work has really waned, and it's especially tough because it's something you used to love. Can you think back to what specifically changed for you? Was there a particular incident, a shift in the organization, or something else that might have contributed to losing that spark?

Patient: Hmm, that's a good question. I think it might have started when we got a new supervisor a couple years back. They came in with all these new rules and paperwork, and it just felt like all the creativity got sucked out of the job. But it's gotten worse since the breakup, I've just felt... empty. My ex was always so supportive, always there to talk through the tough cases. Now, I just feel alone in it all.

Therapist: It sounds like the loss of your ex's support has made a big difference in how you feel about your work. What would it take for you to feel like you're not alone in those tough cases anymore?

Patient: I'm not sure, really. I mean, I have colleagues, but it's not the same. They're all busy with their own cases, and it's not like I can just dump my problems on them. I guess I just need someone to talk to, someone who gets it, you know? But I don't know where to find that anymore.

Therapist: You're looking for someone who understands what it's like to be a social worker and to have those kinds of challenges. Can you think of a time when you felt like you had someone who got it, who was supportive and understanding? What was that like for you?

Patient: Well, of course, there was my ex. They were always there to listen, always understood why I cared so much about my cases. They'd help me brainstorm ideas or just let me vent. It was like having my own personal cheerleader, you know? But that's gone now. I suppose there were times with colleagues too, early on in my career, where we'd all support each other. But it's different now, everyone's so busy and stressed.

Therapist: It sounds like having that kind of support made a big difference for you. What would it take for you to create a similar sense of community and support among your colleagues now?

Patient: Oh, I don't know. I mean, I've thought about it, but everyone's so buried under their own work. I don't want to add more to their plates and I can't just force people to be friends, can I? Plus, I'm not even sure what I want anymore. It's all so overwhelming, and I just... I just don't know where to start.

Therapist: You're right that you can't force people to be friends, but what if taking small steps towards building connections with your colleagues, even if it's just a conversation or a coffee break, might help you figure out what you want and what kind of support you need?

Patient: Maybe, but I don't know... it's just so hard to think about right now. I mean, I've got all these cases piling up, and my supervisor is always breathing down my neck. Where am I supposed to find the time and energy for all that? Plus, what if they don't want to connect? What if I'm just bothering them?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about reaching out to colleagues because you're afraid of being rejected or bothering them. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if someone did reject you or didn't want to connect? What's the worst that could come of it?

Patient: I guess I'm just afraid they'll think I'm stupid or annoying. Or maybe they'll just ignore me, and that'll be even worse. I don't know if I can handle any more rejection right now, you know? It's already been so hard with the breakup.

Therapist: It sounds like you're afraid of being rejected and judged by your colleagues, and that's really tough to face. Can you tell me more about what it would mean to you if someone saw you as "stupid" or "annoying"? Is there something in particular that would make you feel like you're not good enough or that you're not worthy of connection?

Patient: I think it's just... I've always been the one helping others, you know? I'm the social worker, I'm supposed to have it together. If they see me struggling, see me as stupid or annoying, then what does that say about me? I just... I don't want them to think less of me. I wouldn't know what to do if that happened.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really worried about being seen as weak or incompetent, and that's making it hard for you to ask for help or reach out to your colleagues. What would happen if you were to let go of the idea that you always have to be the one who has it together, and you were to allow yourself to be vulnerable and ask for help when you need it?

Patient: I don't know, really. I mean, I guess maybe they'd understand? But it's just so hard to imagine. I've always been the strong one, the helper. I don't know how to be any other way. And what if they don't understand? What if they just think I'm not cut out for this anymore?

Therapist: It sounds like being a strong and capable social worker is a big part of who you are and what you value about yourself. Can you tell me more about what would happen to your sense of purpose and identity if you were to acknowledge that you're struggling and need help?

Patient: I guess I just don't know who I am if I'm not the strong one. I mean, I've always been the one people come to for help. If I'm struggling, who does that make me? It's like... I don't know what my purpose is anymore.

Therapist: It sounds like being able to help others is a big part of what gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. Can you think of a time when you were able to help someone in a really meaningful way? What was it about that experience that made it so fulfilling for you?

Patient: Well, there was this one client, years ago. She was a single mom, struggling with addiction, and her kids were in foster care. Everyone had kind of written her off, but I just saw something in her, you know? I fought for her, helped her get into a treatment program, supported her through it all. She's sober now, has her kids back, and she even sends me Christmas cards every year. It's just... knowing I made a difference like that, it's the best feeling in the world.

Therapist: That sounds like a truly remarkable experience. It's clear that making a difference in someone's life has a profound impact on you. What if you were to focus on finding ways to make a meaningful difference in your work right now, even if it's in a small way? What might that look like for you?

Patient: I don't know, really. I mean, I guess I could start by just trying to be more present with my clients. Maybe really listen to them, you know? Not just go through the motions. But it's hard, I'm just so tired all the time. And what if it's not enough? What if I still feel like something's missing?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that no matter how hard you try, it won't be enough. Can you think of a time when you felt like you were doing something that was meaningful and fulfilling, even if it wasn't perfect? What was it about that experience that made it feel fulfilling, despite any imperfections?

Patient: Honestly, I can't really think of anything right now. It's all just a blur. I mean, I know I've had those moments, but... it's like they're hidden behind this thick fog, and I can't quite reach them. Everything just feels so heavy, so confusing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from your own experiences and emotions right now. Can you imagine what it would be like to allow yourself to feel whatever emotions arise, without judgment, and to trust that you can handle them?

Patient: I don't know. I mean, I guess? But it's just so hard, you know? I've always been the one helping others, not the other way around. I just... I don't know how to do this. I don't know what I need. I just want to feel like myself again.

Therapist: It sounds like being selfless and helping others has been a big part of who you are for a long time. Can you imagine what it would be like to prioritize your own needs and feelings for a change, even if it's just for a little while? What might that feel like for you?

Patient: It would feel... strange. Selfish, even. I don't know how to put myself first. It's always been about everyone else. I wouldn't even know where to start.

Therapist: It sounds like you feel a strong sense of responsibility to put others first, but what if taking care of yourself was not selfish, but necessary? What if prioritizing your own needs was actually a way of being more available and effective for others in the long run?

Patient: Maybe. I just... I don't know how to do that. It's always been about everyone else. I wouldn't even know where to start. It's not like I have anything left to give anyway. I'm just so tired.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really depleted and unsure of how to start taking care of yourself. Can you allow yourself to receive this feeling of exhaustion as a signal that you need to prioritize your own well-being, rather than trying to push through it?

Patient: I guess so. I mean, I am just so tired. All the time. Maybe... maybe I do need to do something about it. But what? I don't want to let anyone down. It's just all so overwhelming.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling caught between your desire to take care of yourself and your sense of responsibility towards others. Can you imagine what it would be like to take small steps towards prioritizing your own well-being, even if it means saying no to others or setting boundaries?

Patient: I don't know. I mean, I guess I could maybe start saying no to some of the extra cases I've been taking on. But it's just so hard to do. I don't want to disappoint anyone.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about disappointing others if you say no to cases. What if you were to approach it from a different perspective, and say yes to yourself instead? What would it mean for you to prioritize your own needs and well-being?

Patient: I guess it would mean... actually thinking about what I need for a change. Maybe it would mean taking a break. Or asking for help. It's just... it's so hard to even think about. I've never been very good at that.

Therapist: It sounds like taking care of yourself is a scary but potentially liberating idea for you. What would it mean for you to take a break, not just from work, but from the pressure to be perfect and help everyone else?
