# Transcript T13

Patient: Hey, thanks for having me. Lately, I've been really stuck in my own head about work. I've been worrying a lot about my performance as a software developer, and it's been leading to a lot of procrastination. It's just been tough to shake off this anxiety.

Therapist: What specific parts of your performance as a software developer are you worried you're not doing well, or what are you worried others might think you're not doing well?

Patient: I dunno, it's just a general feeling I guess. Like, I'll look at a task and start thinking, "What if I mess this up?" or "What if it takes too long and they think I'm not good enough?". It's not like there's one specific thing I'm worried about, it's more like a general fear of not meeting expectations.

Therapist: Those "what if" thoughts can be pretty paralyzing. What do you think you'd be saying about yourself as a developer if you were to believe those thoughts - that you're not good enough, that you'll mess things up?

Patient: I guess I'd be saying that I'm incompetent, that I can't handle this job. That I was a fool to think I could take on this new role.

Therapist: That sounds like a pretty harsh self-critic. What do you think you'd be doing for yourself by holding onto this idea that you're incompetent and not cut out for the job?

Patient: I don't know, really. Maybe it's just easier to think that way? Like, if I expect the worst, then I won't be disappointed if it happens. It's kind of a safety net, in a weird way.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using this self-critical narrative to avoid feeling disappointed, but what might you be giving up by doing that - like, what might you be missing out on in terms of growth or experiences, or even just feeling more confident in your abilities?

Patient: I suppose if I keep thinking this way, I might miss out on actually feeling good about what I do. Maybe I'd pass up opportunities to take on more challenging projects or learn new things because I'd always be telling myself I can't do it. I guess it could hold me back from growing as a developer.

Therapist: What does being a developer mean to you, in terms of who you are and what you value about your work?

Patient: Being a developer, it's not just a job for me. It's a big part of my identity. I value the problem-solving, the creativity, and the constant learning. It's like working on puzzles all day, and I really enjoy that. It's also important to me to be good at it, to feel competent.

Therapist: Given how much you value being competent and good at your job, what would it take for you to start seeing yourself as competent and capable, even when faced with challenges or uncertainty?

Patient: That's a tough one. I guess I'd need to see some consistent successes, maybe get some positive feedback from colleagues or superiors. But it's not just about that. I think I also need to be able to handle failures or setbacks without spiraling into self-doubt. That's where I get stuck the most.

Therapist: When you're faced with a failure or setback, what would you say to yourself in that moment to help you stay present and move forward, rather than getting caught up in self-doubt?

Patient: Honestly, I don't know. Right now, I usually end up telling myself stuff like, "You should have known better" or "This is why you can't do this job." I guess I need to find something more helpful to say. Maybe something like, "Okay, this happened. What can I learn from it?" But it's hard to believe that in the moment.

Therapist: Let's try an experiment. Next time you catch yourself saying something like "You should have known better," see if you can pause for a moment and rephrase it to "This happened, and I'm here to learn from it." Then, ask yourself, "What can I learn from this, and how can I apply it moving forward?"

Patient: Okay, I can try that. No promises, though. It's not easy to catch those thoughts in the moment. But I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: What if, in the moments leading up to when you're usually caught up in self-criticism, you could take a brief pause - just a deep breath or a moment of silence - to check in with yourself and ask, "What's going on right now? What am I feeling?"

Patient: I don't see how that would help. I already know what I'm feeling - anxious, stressed. I don't need to pause and check in to know that.

Therapist: But what if, instead of just labeling your emotions as anxious or stressed, you could ask yourself, "What's the story I'm telling myself about being anxious or stressed?" What's the narrative that's unfolding in your mind right now?

Patient: You mean, like, what am I actually thinking when I'm feeling anxious? I guess I could try that. Might give me a better handle on what's really going on. But I'm not sure it'll make a difference.

Therapist: That's exactly it. By becoming more aware of the story you're telling yourself, you might find that it's not as fixed or true as you thought. You might start to see that it's just one possible interpretation, and that gives you some space to choose how you respond to it.

Patient: Yeah, maybe. I mean, I get what you're saying, but it's still hard to believe that it's just a story. It feels pretty real when I'm in it. But I guess I can try to notice it more, see where it goes.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have - a willingness to experiment. Let's try a small experiment. Next time you're in the midst of a stressful or anxious moment, see if you can say to yourself, "This is the story I'm telling myself about this situation, not necessarily what's actually happening."

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. But what if I can't remember to do that in the moment? I get so caught up in the anxiety that it's hard to think of anything else.

Therapist: That's a good point - it can be hard to remember to do something new when you're feeling anxious. What if, in addition to trying to remember the phrase "This is the story I'm telling myself," you also set up a small reminder for yourself, like a post-it note on your desk or a reminder on your phone, to help you stay on track?

Patient: I guess that could work. I could set up a reminder on my computer, maybe something subtle that wouldn't be too obvious to anyone else. I'm just not sure what to say to myself when I see it.

Therapist: How about something simple like "Notice the story"? That way, when you see the reminder, you can take a brief moment to pause and notice the thoughts that are going through your mind, without having to remember a longer phrase.

Patient: Okay, I can do that. "Notice the story." I'll give it a try.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. Remember, the goal isn't to change your thoughts or feelings immediately, but to develop a greater awareness of them. Be patient with yourself and keep in mind that it's okay if you forget sometimes. Just acknowledge that and try again.

Patient: Yeah, I get that. It's still hard to believe that just noticing my thoughts will make much of a difference, but I'll try it and see what happens. I'm not promising anything, though.

Therapist: That's completely fair. I'm not expecting you to see immediate results or have a specific outcome in mind. Just commit to showing up to your experiences with a sense of curiosity and openness, and see what happens.

Patient: Alright, I can do that. Curiosity and openness. Let's see where this goes.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember, it's not about having all the answers or knowing what's going to happen. It's about being willing to show up to the present moment with an open mind and heart. Take care of yourself and let's check in next time to see how things are going.

Patient: Yeah, okay. I can try that. I mean, I'm not making any promises, but I'll give it a shot. See you next time.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty and willingness to try something new. That takes a lot of courage. I'm looking forward to our next session and hearing about your experiences. Take care of yourself and see you soon.

Patient: Thanks. I'll do my best. See you next time.

Therapist: (Internal reflection) This session was a good start in helping the patient become more aware of their thoughts and emotions, and to consider a more compassionate and open approach to their experiences. Next session will focus on further developing this awareness and exploring ways to apply it in daily life.

Patient: Yeah, that sounds good. I'm still not totally convinced, but I'll give it a shot. See you next time.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to keep an open mind and give it a try. That's all I can ask for. I'll see you next time, and we can continue this conversation. Have a good day.
