# Transcript T39

Patient: Hi, thanks for meeting with me today. Lately, I've been really stuck in this cycle of worrying about my job performance. It's like I can't focus on anything else, and it's leading to a lot of procrastination. I know I need to get things done, but the more I worry, the harder it is to start. It's been really frustrating and overwhelming, especially with everything else going on with my family.

Therapist: That cycle sounds really tough to break free from. What's one specific task or project at work that you've been putting off because of these worries, and what's the worst-case scenario you imagine happening if you don't get it done perfectly?

Patient: I've been putting off starting this new feature for our software. It's a big project, and I keep envisioning that if I don't get it done perfectly, or if I miss a deadline the client will blame me, maybe even ask the company to replace me. It's like I can already see the disappointed look on my boss's face, and it's just paralyzing. I know it might not be rational, but I can't shake the feeling. What if I actually mess it up?

Therapist: What is it about being blamed or replaced that's most worrisome for you? Is it the loss of job security, the impact on your self-image, or something else entirely?

Patient: It's a mix of things, I guess. The loss of job security is a big part of it. I have a family to support, and the thought of letting them down is awful. But it's also about my self-image. I've always prided myself on being good at my job, and the idea of failing at something so public...I'm not sure I could handle that. It's like I'd be proving all my self-doubts right, you know?

Therapist: What would be one thing you could do today, not perfectly, but just take a small step towards starting this feature, without having to have it all figured out, that would allow you to feel like you're moving forward and taking care of yourself and your family?

Patient: I'm not sure, really. I mean, I guess I could start by just outlining the basic structure of the feature? That wouldn't require everything to be perfect right away, but it would be a start. I don't know if that would make me feel like I'm taking care of my family, though. It feels like I need to do more, to be sure. But maybe that's just my anxiety talking.

Therapist: What if you could take this first step of outlining the feature's structure, and then, without judgment, notice what happens with your anxiety afterwards? Is there a part of you that might feel a sense of relief, or accomplishment, even if it's small?

Patient: Maybe, yeah. I mean, I suppose just starting might take some of the pressure off. But it's hard to imagine that just doing this one small thing would make a difference. At the same time, I'm tired of feeling like this, so I guess it's worth a try. I just don't want to get my hopes up too much.

Therapist: Can you imagine taking that first step, outlining the feature's structure, and then, rather than focusing on the outcome, simply paying attention to the physical sensations in your body and the thoughts in your mind in this moment? What would you notice?

Patient: I can try. I mean, if I imagine doing that, the first thing I notice is a knot in my stomach. It's like my body is just waiting for something to go wrong. And my mind is racing with all the things that could happen, all the ways this could backfire. But there's a small part of me, maybe, that feels a bit lighter. Like, okay, at least I did something. It's not much, but it's there.

Therapist: That lighter feeling, the sense of "at least I did something" – what if you were to lean into that feeling a bit more, and see if you can allow yourself to feel proud of taking that small step, rather than getting caught up in the worst-case scenarios?

Patient: Easier said than done. I'm not sure I deserve to feel proud just for doing something so small. But I get what you're saying. Maybe I can try to hold onto that feeling, even if it's just for a moment. It's just hard to focus on the positive when there's so much that could go wrong. But I can try, sure.

Therapist: What's one value that's important to you in your work or in taking care of your family, something that feels bigger than just avoiding mistakes or meeting expectations?

Patient: That's a tough one. I guess one value that's important to me is reliability. I want my coworkers to know they can count on me, and I want my family to feel secure, like I'm someone they can lean on. It's not just about meeting expectations, it's about being there for them, being someone they can trust. Even if that means I have to push through some discomfort, I want to be that steady presence. It's just hard to see that when I'm so worried about messing up.

Therapist: What if, rather than focusing on the fear of messing up, you were to imagine yourself as the reliable person you want to be for your family and coworkers? What would that look like in this moment, as you're considering taking the next step on the feature?

Patient: That's a big shift. If I imagine myself as that reliable person, I guess in this moment, I'd be taking a deep breath, maybe acknowledging that I'm feeling anxious, but then starting to outline that feature anyway. I'd be focusing on the fact that every step forward is progress, not just for the project, but for being the person I want to be. It's not easy to see myself that way, but it does feel a bit empowering.

Therapist: What if, in the moments when anxiety creeps in, you were to take a deep breath and remind yourself of this image of yourself as a reliable person, taking action step by step, rather than getting caught up in worst-case scenarios?

Patient: That sounds good in theory, but it's hard to believe it would work. I mean, I can try it, sure. But the anxiety feels so real, so overwhelming. It's like trying to fight a storm with an umbrella. But maybe, just maybe, if I keep reminding myself of that image, it could help a little. It's worth a shot, I guess.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to fight the storm, you were to approach it with a sense of curiosity, wondering what it's like to be in the midst of the anxiety, rather than trying to control it?

Patient: You mean just let it happen? That feels counterintuitive. But I guess I'm curious about what that would look like. So, instead of trying to push the anxiety away or fix it, I'd just...sit with it? Isn't that just giving in to it? I don't know if I can do that. But I am wonderng what it would feel like if I did.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to fix or avoid the anxiety, you were to simply notice its presence, without judgment, and see if you can allow it to be there alongside the image of yourself as a reliable person, taking action step by step?

Patient: I'm not sure I understand how I can do both. If I'm anxious, I'm anxious. How can I just let it be there and still move forward? That feels impossible. But I'm willing to try and see what that feels like. Maybe it's not about getting rid of the anxiety, but finding a way to coexist with it? I don't know if I can, but I can try.

Therapist: What if, as you're outlining the feature, you were to take a few deep breaths, acknowledge the anxiety that's present, and then, without judgment, say to yourself, "Okay, anxiety is here, and I'm still going to take this next step"?

Patient: Okay, I think I can try that. It feels strange to accept the anxiety, but saying that to myself might help me focus. So, deep breath, "Okay, anxiety is here, and I'm still going to take this next step." It feels a bit forced, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what happens.

Therapist: As you continue working on the feature, notice what happens when you say to yourself, "Okay, anxiety is here, and I'm still going to take this next step." Does it change the way you feel, the way you approach the task, or the way you perceive the anxiety?

Patient: It's subtle, but I think it might be helping a bit. It's like, saying that to myself acknowledges the anxiety without letting it take control. It's still there, but it feels a bit more manageable. Like, okay, this is how I feel, but I can still do this. It's not perfect, but it's something. It's hard to describe, but I think it's a start.

Therapist: What if you were to carry this approach with you into other challenging situations, not just when working on the feature, but also when dealing with other aspects of your life, like family responsibilities or other tasks that trigger anxiety?

Patient: That feels daunting. I'm not sure I can do that all the time. This is already hard enough as it is. I guess I could try it, but it's not going to be easy. I need to figure out how to make this work for me before I can think about applying it to other situations. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Therapist: What if, for the next week, you commit to saying, "Okay, anxiety is here, and I'm still going to take this next step" whenever you're working on the feature, and see how that goes?

Patient: Alright, I can do that. Just for the next week, just while working on the feature. Let's see what happens. I won't promise anything, but I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: Let's schedule a follow-up conversation for next week to check in on how it's going and see if you've noticed any changes in your experience while working on the feature.

Patient: Next week, yeah, that works. I'll put it in my calendar. Let's say same time? I can't promise I'll have much to report, but we'll see. Talk to you then.

Therapist: Sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience and seeing how things have progressed. Take care, and I'll talk to you next week.

Patient: See you next week.

Therapist: It was a pleasure working with you. I'll see you next week.

Patient: Yeah, see you then.

Therapist: Have a good day.

Patient: You too.

Therapist: Goodbye.
