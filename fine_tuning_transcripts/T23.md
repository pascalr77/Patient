# Transcript T23

Patient: Hey, so I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. Ever since I had that health scare last month, I've just been stuck in this fog of sadness. It's like I can't find the energy to do anything, and it's starting to affect my relationship. I just don't know how to snap out of it.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, and it makes sense that you're feeling stuck after what you went through. What's one thing you used to enjoy doing, but lately, just can't seem to find the motivation to do, even though you might have enjoyed it or felt good about doing it?

Patient: I used to love painting, I had a daily routine where I would spend hours in my studio, just me and the canvas and it was my favorite time. But now, even thinking about it feels exhausting. I haven't picked up a brush in weeks.

Therapist: You miss that daily routine and the connection you had with painting. What is it about picking up a brush again that feels so exhausting now, is it the thought of getting started, the uncertainty of how your work will turn out, or something else?

Patient: It's just... everything. Getting started feels impossible, like this invisible barrier is blocking me. And even if I could start, what's the point? My art always felt like a reflection of me, and right now, I just don't want to see what comes out. It's easier to just do nothing.

Therapist: That makes sense, it feels like you're hitting a wall and questioning the value of creating when you're not feeling yourself. What do you think this invisible barrier is trying to protect you from, if you were to start creating again?

Patient: I don't know. Maybe it's trying to protect me from failing? Or maybe it's just protecting me from feeling anything at all. It's like if I just stay still, I won't have to deal with any more pain or uncertainty. But I also know that's not healthy and I'm just avoiding the issue.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that staying still isn't a healthy solution, and that's a big step. What would it be like for you to allow yourself to feel the pain and uncertainty, even if it's uncomfortable, rather than avoiding it through inaction?

Patient: I'm not sure I'm ready for that. I mean, I know avoidance isn't helping, but feeling all that... it just seems too much. I've been trying for a while and every time I approach those feelings, I freeze up. I guess I just don't know how to face it without feeling overwhelmed, and I am just so tired of being overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck between wanting to move forward and being scared of the overwhelming feelings that come with facing them. What's one tiny, almost ridiculously small step you might take towards facing those feelings, even if it's just for a few seconds, that doesn't feel completely daunting?

Patient: I guess I could just sit in my studio for a few minutes each day. Not even pick up a brush, just be in there. Maybe that could be a start.

Therapist: Sitting in your studio, just being there, sounds like a gentle start. What is it about being in that space that feels important to you, even if you're not creating, and what would you hope to find or experience by doing that?

Patient: I think just being there might help me remember why I love creating. It's my space, you know? The one place I've always felt most like myself. I hope I can find a piece of that again. Maybe just feeling the environment will spark something, remind me that I'm more than just this... emptiness.

Therapist: That sounds like a powerful connection to your sense of self and your creative identity. What if, while you're sitting in your studio, you allowed yourself to simply acknowledge that sense of self, that feeling of being "most like yourself," without trying to create anything or achieve anything specific? Just being with that sense of identity, in that space?

Patient: But what if I can't feel that anymore? What if I sit there and still feel nothing? I think that's what scares me the most, you know? That it's just gone. That I'm just gone.

Therapist: That's a really scary thought, and it's understandable that you'd want to avoid it. But what if, instead of trying to avoid feeling like you're "gone," you allowed yourself to sit with that uncertainty, to feel the fear and the uncertainty, without trying to change it or make it go away? What would that be like?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I've just been so focused on trying to "fix" things, trying to find a way back to how things were. I haven't really let myself just feel the fear. It sounds terrifying, but maybe it's something I need to face.

Therapist: That's a really big insight, recognizing the pattern of trying to fix things. What if, in those moments when you're feeling the fear of being "gone," you could allow yourself to say, "This is what it's like to be afraid," rather than trying to change it or make it go away?

Patient: I'm not sure I understand. You mean like, just accept that I'm afraid? That feels weird. Like I'm giving up. But I guess it's also exhausting, always trying to fight it.

Therapist: It might feel like giving up, but acceptance isn't about giving up - it's about taking a different kind of action. What if, instead of fighting the fear, you were using that energy to take small steps towards reconnecting with your creative self, like sitting in your studio, and seeing what happens from there?

Patient: But what if it doesn't work? What if I still feel stuck? I just don't want to be disappointed again.

Therapist: That's a totally understandable fear, but what if you could approach this with a sense of curiosity, rather than expectation? What if you could say to yourself, "I'm not sure if this will work, but I'm willing to try it and see what happens, without needing a specific outcome?"

Patient: Easier said than done. I'm not really sure how to do that, to be honest. I feel like I've lost that curiosity. I just feel flat.

Therapist: That flatness can be really hard to deal with. Can you think of a time when you felt curious about something, even if it was a small thing, like a book or a movie or a conversation? What was it about that experience that sparked your curiosity?

Patient: I guess I was really into this podcast about art history a while back. I liked learning about all these artists, their lives, their struggles. It made me feel connected to something bigger. But even that feels kind of overwhelming now.

Therapist: It sounds like that podcast was a source of inspiration for you, but now it feels overwhelming. What if you were to approach it in a different way, like listening to just one episode a week, or reading a small article about an artist? Would that feel more manageable, and could it be a way to start reconnecting with your interest in art history?

Patient: Maybe. I guess I could try that. Just one episode, no pressure. But what if it doesn't help? What if I still feel like this?

Therapist: That's a fair question, and it's okay to not know what will happen. But what if, instead of focusing on whether it will "help" or not, you could approach this as an experiment, just to see what happens when you engage with the podcast in a small way? What if you could say to yourself, "I'm going to try this, and I'll see what happens, without needing a specific outcome"?

Patient: I can try that. Just an experiment. But I can't promise I'll like it. Or that it will change anything. But I can try.

Therapist: That's a really great attitude to have. And you know, it's not about liking it or not liking it, or even about it changing anything. It's about taking small steps towards reconnecting with things that matter to you, and seeing what happens. What if you were to apply this same approach to sitting in your studio, and just being there, without expecting a specific outcome?

Patient: I guess I can do that too. Just sit there. Just be. We'll see.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a small but important step towards reconnecting with your creative self. Can we schedule a follow-up session to check in on your progress, and see if there's anything else we can work on together?

Patient: Yeah, sure. Let's see how this goes first. When do you want to talk again?

Therapist: Let's schedule a follow-up session for two weeks from now. I'd like to check in and see how this new approach is going, and we can adjust our plan from there. Sound good?

Patient: Two weeks. Okay, I can do that. I'll try this stuff and we'll see.

Therapist: Sounds good, I'll see you in two weeks then. Have a good week, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before then.

Patient: See you in two weeks.

Therapist: It was a pleasure working with you. I hope you find the courage to continue exploring your creativity and your sense of self.

Patient: Thanks. I'll try. We'll see what happens.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember, it's not about achieving a specific outcome, but about taking small steps towards growth and exploration. I'm looking forward to our next session.
