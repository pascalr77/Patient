# Transcript T35

Patient: I've been feeling a bit lost lately. I've always defined myself by my job as a software developer, but with the recent instability at work, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing with my life. It's like I'm stuck in neutral, just waiting for something to happen. I'm not even sure what matters to me anymore.

Therapist: That sense of being lost and uncertain about what matters can be really unsettling. What specifically about the instability at work is making you question what you're supposed to be doing with your life, and how does that relate to what you've always defined as your identity as a software developer?

Patient: I think it's just that work was always my go-to, my comfort zone. I knew who I was when I was coding, solving problems. But now, with the layoffs and the uncertainty, it's like the rug's been pulled out from under me. If I'm not the software developer guy, then who am I? It's not like I have a bunch of hobbies or other interests. I just feel kind of empty, I guess. I don't really see how talking about it will help, but I figure it's worth a shot.

Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like the job was a big part of your sense of self. Can you think of one thing you used to enjoy or be good at outside of coding, something that might not be directly related to your job, but still feels like a part of you?

Patient: Not really, doc. I mean, I've always been the tech guy, even before I was a software developer. I liked video games as a kid, but I don't have time for that stuff anymore. I don't see how that helps me now.

Therapist: It sounds like you're pretty sure that past interests aren't relevant now. What do you think would happen if you were to revisit or explore those interests, even just a little, like playing a video game or something?

Patient: I don't know, I guess I just feel like that's not something grown-ups do. I mean, I've got bills to pay and a career to worry about. Video games seem like a waste of time, to be honest. I don't see how that's going to help me figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of responsibility to your career and financial stability. What does "being a responsible adult" mean to you, and how does that influence your decisions about how you spend your time?

Patient: Being a responsible adult means taking care of business, not indulging in silly stuff. It means focusing on work, paying bills, keeping everything together. That's the way I was raised. That's what you do. There's not a lot of time left over for other things. I just feel like I need to figure out my next move career-wise, not mess around with other stuff.

Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of duty to be responsible and take care of things. What do you think would happen if you were to take a small amount of time for yourself, just a tiny break from focusing on work and responsibilities, to explore what might bring you a sense of fulfillment or joy, even if it's not directly related to your career?

Patient: I really don't know. I guess I've just never considered it. I'm not even sure I'd know what to do with that time. It's not that I'm against the idea, it's just... foreign, I guess. I just worry that if I take my eye off the ball, everything will fall apart. But honestly, with how things are going at work, I'm not sure my way is working anymore.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that if you take your eye off the ball, everything will fall apart. What specifically do you think would fall apart if you took a small break from work? What's the worst-case scenario you're envisioning?

Patient: I guess I'm worried I'll miss out on a job opportunity, or I'll fall behind on my skills. This industry moves fast, you know? I don't want to wake up one day and realize I'm obsolete. Plus, I don't want to burden anyone else with my problems. I just feel like I need to stay vigilant, keep pushing. The worst-case scenario? I guess I'm afraid I'll end up unemployed, useless.

Therapist: It sounds like a lot of your sense of identity and worth is tied up in being a successful software developer. What would happen to your sense of self-worth if you were to take a break from work and not be actively contributing to your field?

Patient: I think I'd feel pretty worthless, to be honest. Like I'm letting everyone down. Like I'm not living up to my potential. I've always been the smart, responsible one. If I'm not doing that, then who even am I? It's not like I have much else going on in my life. It's just been work, work, work. I do feel stuck, and I do want to do other things, but the thought of actually trying feels scary.

Therapist: It sounds like a lot of your sense of identity is tied to being the "smart, responsible one." What if that identity wasn't the only one you had? What if you were to define yourself in other ways, beyond your job?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. I am the smart, responsible one. That's who I've always been. I just don't see what else there is. I mean, I guess I'm a brother, a son, but those are just labels. They don't really mean anything. I don't know how to be anything other than what I am. I just want to feel like I'm doing something worthwhile.

Therapist: It sounds like feeling worthwhile is really important to you. What does being worthwhile mean to you, in a way that goes beyond your job or professional success?

Patient: I guess I'm not sure. That's what it's always been. I suppose if I'm not just a software developer, then maybe being worthwhile means being someone people can count on. Being helpful, maybe. I don't know, this is hard to think about. I just want to feel like I have a purpose, I guess. It's not like I have a family of my own or anything. I just feel like I'm at a crossroads, but I don't know what the other paths are.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and unsure about what the future holds. Can you think of a time in your life when you felt like you were making a positive impact or helping someone, even if it wasn't related to your job? What was that like for you?

Patient: I guess there was this one time, my neighbor's kid was having trouble with his math homework. I helped him figure it out. He was just so happy, so relieved. It felt good, I suppose. It was nice to see the difference I made, right there in front of me. But that was just a one-time thing. It's not like that's a career or anything.

Therapist: That sounds like a really meaningful experience. What do you think it was about helping that kid with his math homework that felt so good to you? Was it the sense of making a difference, or something else?

Patient: It was just nice to see the result, I guess. To see him happy. It was a clear problem, and I could fix it. Most of the time, it's just... I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, what the point is. With the kid, I could see it right away. It was simple.

Therapist: It sounds like you value being able to see a clear problem and solve it. What do you think is missing from your current situation that's making it harder to feel like you're making progress or having a clear sense of direction?

Patient: I just don't know what the goal is anymore. With work, it was always about the next project, the next promotion. Now, it's like I'm in open water, no land in sight. I don't even know what I want. I don't know where to start. It's like I'm waiting for someone to tell me what to do, but there's no one. It's just me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to have a clear direction, but it's not there. Can you think of a time in your life when you've had to navigate uncertainty and figure things out on your own? How did you handle it then?

Patient: I guess there was a time when I first started out in my career. I didn't know what I was doing, not really. I just took it one step at a time. I asked for help when I needed it. I figured it out eventually. But this feels different. Bigger, somehow. It's not just about a job, it's about my whole life. I just don't know how to tackle something so... vast. I need a plan, a goal. Something.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to have a clear plan and goal, but it's not coming easily. What if, instead of trying to come up with a comprehensive plan, you were to focus on taking one small step towards something that interests you, something that feels meaningful, even if it's not a big, overarching goal?

Patient: I don't know. That seems... it feels like I'm just delaying the inevitable. Like I'm wasting time. But I guess I don't really have any better ideas. I just don't want to end up sad and alone, you know? I want to feel like I'm living life, not just watching it pass by. So maybe, just maybe, I could try something small. But I'm not making any promises.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of urgency and wanting to make the most of your life. What would be the worst that could happen if you took one small step towards something that interests you, even if it didn't work out?

Patient: I guess the worst that could happen is that I'd be out whatever time I invested. Maybe I'd be a bit disappointed. But it's not like taking one small step is going to ruin my life, is it? It's just... I don't want to look stupid. I don't want to fail. But everybody fails sometimes, right? I just have to make sure it's not another item on the list of things I regret not pursuing sooner.

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that failure is a normal part of life and that it's not the end of the world. Can you think of a time when you took a risk and it didn't work out, but you learned something valuable from it? What was that experience like, and what did you learn from it?

Patient: I guess there was a time I tried to start my own side business, a consulting thing. It didn't really take off. I was pretty bummed about it at the time, but looking back, I learned a lot. I learned what I'm good at, what I'm not. I learned how to market myself, how to put myself out there. It wasn't a total loss, I guess. It just didn't go the way I planned. But whose life goes exactly as planned?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that failure can be a valuable learning experience. What if you were to approach this current situation with a similar mindset, as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a fixed plan that needs to succeed?

Patient: You mean, like, just try stuff? See what happens? I don't know. That goes against every fiber of my being. I like plans. I like goals. But I get what you're saying. Maybe if I stop trying to make everything so perfect, so set in stone, I'd actually get somewhere. I just don't know where to start.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck between your desire for control and the desire to take a more flexible approach. What do you think would happen if you were to give yourself permission to not have all the answers, to not have everything figured out right now?

Patient: I don't know. I think I'd feel pretty anxious. But maybe also a bit relieved? It's just hard to let go, you know? I've always had a plan. Always. But maybe... maybe it's okay if I don't for a bit. Maybe it's okay to just... be. I don't know. It's scary. But what's the alternative? Keep banging my head against the wall? Something's got to change, right?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of desperation and a desire for change. What do you think you would gain by letting go of the need for a plan and embracing uncertainty?

Patient: Freedom, maybe? A chance to actually live my life instead of just ticking off boxes. But it's scary, too. It feels like jumping off a cliff. Maybe there's something better at the bottom, maybe there isn't. But at least it's something, right? At least it's not just... this.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hope and a desire for change. What if you were to trust that you'll figure things out as you go, and that you'll find a way to navigate the uncertainty?
