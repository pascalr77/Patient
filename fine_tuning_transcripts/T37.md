Patient: Hi, I've been feeling really off lately. Since my breakup, I've been having a hard time managing my anger and frustration. It's like every little thing sets me off, and I can't help but feel resentful. It's not like me to be this way, and it's starting to affect my work as a social worker and my relationships. I guess I just feel stuck and I know that I need a change.

Therapist: That feeling of not being like yourself and feeling stuck is really tough. How do you think being in this state affects your work as a social worker, especially in terms of connecting with clients or navigating challenging situations?

Patient: I find myself being more impatient with my clients, which I hate to admit. I'm usually able to stay calm and understanding, but lately I've been snapping more easily. It's like my fuse is shorter. And that's not fair to them – they need my support and empathy, not my irritability. I guess that's why I know I need to figure this out.

Therapist: That must be really challenging for you, both personally and professionally. What's happening right before you snap at clients? Is there a specific thought or situation that tends to precede those moments?

Patient: I think it's when they're not helping themselves, you know? When they're just stuck in their problems and not taking any initiative. I know it's not fair of me to expect them to just snap out of it, but lately it's been really grating on me. It's like I'm thinking, "Come on, you can do something about this," and then I just get so frustrated.

Therapist: That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself, and then on your clients. What do you think you're hoping to achieve when you're thinking "Come on, you can do something about this"? What's at the heart of that expectation?

Patient: I guess I just want them to be better. I want them to take control of their lives and make positive changes. I know that's what I would want for myself – to be proactive and not just stuck in my problems. Maybe I'm just projecting that onto them.

Therapist: That's a very honest insight – recognizing you're projecting your own desires onto them. When you think about your own life, what does being "stuck" look like for you, and what are some things you wish you could take more control over?

Patient: Well, right now, being stuck looks like me coming home from work exhausted and just dwelling on the breakup. I replay conversations in my head, think about what I could have done differently. I wish I could let go of that and just move forward, you know? Focus on my own happiness and growth. But it's like I'm stuck in this cycle of anger and resentment, and I can't seem to break out of it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with this cycle of rumination. What do you think you're getting out of dwelling on these past conversations, even though it's not helping you move forward?

Patient: I think maybe it gives me a sense of control? Like, if I can figure out what went wrong, then I can maybe fix it, or at least understand it. But at the same time, I know it's not rational. It's already happened, and I can't change it. Plus, it's not like me to be so stuck in the past. I just want to find a way to learn from it and move on.

Therapist: That sense of control is really important to you, isn't it? When you think about it, what does it mean to you to have control, and how does it relate to who you are as a person?

Patient: Having control means I get to decide the outcome of things. It means I'm not at the mercy of someone else's decisions or actions. I think as a social worker, I see a lot of people who feel helpless, and I never want to feel that way. I want to know that I can make choices that matter and change things for the better.

Therapist: That's a really powerful value – wanting to make a difference and have control over your life. Given that, how do you think your fear of feeling helpless is showing up in your emotions and behavior right now, especially since the breakup?

Patient: I guess it's showing up as anger. When I feel like I can't control something, I get frustrated and lash out. It's like I'm trying to push against this feeling of helplessness, but it's only making things worse. I think that's why I've been so on edge with my clients too – I see them struggling, and it reminds me of my own feelings of powerlessness. It's a lot easier to feel angry than it is to feel helpless, but I know it's not healthy.

Therapist: You're recognizing that anger isn't a healthy way to deal with feelings of helplessness. What do you think you might do instead, when you're feeling overwhelmed and powerless, that would feel more in line with your values as a social worker and as a person?

Patient: Maybe I could try to acknowledge those feelings of helplessness and just let them be there for a moment, instead of trying to push them away with anger. I could try to have some compassion for myself, like I would for one of my clients. Maybe that means talking to a friend or even journaling about it – just something to help me process what I'm feeling instead of trying to stuff it down or lash out.

Therapist: That's a beautiful idea – treating yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you offer to your clients. How do you think you can start to put that into practice, in small ways, in your daily life, like right now?

Patient: I guess I could start by just taking a moment to acknowledge how I'm feeling right now, without judging it or trying to change it. Just admitting to myself that I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and helpless, and that's okay. Maybe I could even write about it later, just to get it out of my head. I don't know, this is all still pretty new to me.

Therapist: That's a great start – acknowledging your feelings and allowing yourself to feel overwhelmed without trying to change it. What do you think would happen if you started to take a few moments each day to do just that – acknowledge your emotions, without judgment – how might that impact your relationships with yourself and others, including your clients?

Patient: I'm not sure exactly what would happen, but I hope it would help me be more patient. With myself and with others. Maybe I wouldn't be so quick to snap at my clients or feel so resentful towards my ex. But I guess I'm also worried that if I let myself feel these emotions, they'll be too much and I won't be able to handle it.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a part of you that's worried about being overwhelmed, and that's making you hesitant to let yourself feel these emotions. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to feel overwhelmed, not as a goal, but just as a possibility?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'm afraid I would just crash. Break down. Not be able to function. I don't want to go to that dark place. But maybe... maybe it wouldn't be as bad as I think. Maybe I could actually handle it.

Therapist: That's a really interesting thought – that maybe you could handle it. What if, instead of trying to avoid going to that "dark place," you were to approach it with an attitude of curiosity, rather than fear? What might you learn about yourself and your capabilities?

Patient: I'm not sure what I'd learn, but maybe I'd see that I'm stronger than I think. Or maybe I'd realize that it's okay to not have it all together all the time. But I'm just afraid of falling apart. I'm supposed to be the strong one, the one who helps others. If I fall apart, who am I then?

Therapist: It sounds like being the "strong one" is a big part of your identity, and the thought of losing that is really scary. But what if, instead of being the strong one, you could be someone who is imperfect, vulnerable, and still worthy of love and respect?

Patient: You make it sound so easy. But it's not. I've always been the one others depend on, and I don't know if I can just let that go. But at the same time, I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling like I have to be strong all the time. I just don't know how to be any other way.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of exhaustion with being the strong one, and a desire for something more. What if, instead of trying to be strong all the time, you could just be present, exactly as you are, in this moment?

Patient: I don't know if I can. But I want to try, but I'm not even sure what that looks like.

Therapist: That's a great starting point – wanting to try something new. Can you take a deep breath and imagine yourself being present, exactly as you are, without trying to be strong or perfect? What do you notice in that moment?

Patient: I feel a little bit of tension in my shoulders. And I guess I feel a little bit sad. But also maybe a little bit relieved? It's like I don't have to pretend, even if it's just for a moment.

Therapist: It sounds like you're having a really honest moment with yourself. What if, instead of trying to change or control this feeling of tension and sadness, you could just allow it to be there, as a part of who you are in this moment?

Patient: I don't know if I can. It's hard. But... I'll try. I'll try to just let it be there, even if it's uncomfortable. Maybe it won't be as bad as I thought.

Therapist: That's a beautiful commitment – to letting it be there, even if it's uncomfortable. What do you think would happen if you were to make this a regular practice, allowing yourself to be present with your emotions, even when they're difficult?

Patient: I might feel more at peace. But I'm also afraid I might feel more pain. I guess I'm just used to pushing things away. But maybe, just maybe, it would help me heal. I won't know unless I try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're taking a big step towards healing, by being willing to feel the pain and uncertainty that comes with it. What do you think it would mean for your life if you were to heal from this past experience, and move forward in a more authentic and present way?

Patient: I think I'd be more at peace with myself. I'd be able to let go of this anger and just be. I think I'd be better able to help my clients too, if I could model that kind of acceptance. But I'm not sure I'm ready to let go of the past just yet. It's still so fresh.

Therapist: It's completely understandable that the past feels fresh and difficult to let go of. Can you take a moment to acknowledge the pain and grief that you're still carrying, and give yourself permission to feel it, rather than trying to rush towards healing or acceptance?

Patient: That's really hard to do. I feel like I should be moving on, not dwelling on the pain. But... okay. Okay, I can feel it. It's like a weight on my chest. It's heavy and it hurts. But it's there. I can feel it.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and feel this pain. What if, instead of trying to move on or rush towards healing, you were to allow yourself to stay with this pain for a little while, and see what it has to teach you?
