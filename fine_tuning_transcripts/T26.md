# Transcript T26

Patient: I've been feeling stuck lately. I worry a lot about my work, how much longer I can keep up as a data scientist at my age. It's been leading to procrastination and I can't seem to shake it off. I'm not sure what to make of it.

Therapist: What is it about being a data scientist at your age that's causing you to worry about your future in this role?

Patient: It's not that I can't do my job, I can. Always have. But things change so fast in this field. I worry that I'm not keeping up with the kids, fresh out of university. I can't help but think, what if I wake up one day and I'm obsolete?

Therapist: What does the possibility of being "obsolete" mean to you, in terms of your identity and sense of self-worth?

Patient: I've always been the smart one, the one people come to for answers. If I'm obsolete, who am I then? Just an old man with nothing to offer? It's not just about the job, it's about losing my place in the world. But I guess that sounds dramatic. I don't know.

Therapist: What's one thing that would give you a sense of being valued and contributing, even if it's not directly related to being the "smart one" or being a data scientist?

Patient: I suppose if I could share my experience, maybe mentor someone. But who would want an old man like me as a mentor? I don't know if that would make me feel valued, but it's something different. I'm not sure it would help.

Therapist: What would you need to feel confident that you have something valuable to offer as a mentor, and that someone would actually want to learn from you?

Patient: I guess I'd need to see that they respect my experience. That they're actually listening, not just humoring an old man. But I don't know if that's enough. I don't know if I have it in me to be a mentor. It's not just about knowledge, is it? It's about connection too. I don't know if I'm good at that part.

Therapist: What does connection mean to you, and what would it look like for you to feel like you're genuinely connecting with someone, especially in a mentorship role?

Patient: I suppose connection means understanding, not just being heard but being listened to.  Feeling like I'm not just talking to a void. Someone would need to be more than just polite. They should be asking questions, getting me to think about things in a new light too. I'm not just a walking textbook, I can help them work through problems. At least, I hope I can.

Therapist: What values would you be living into if you were able to have these kinds of meaningful, mutually engaging relationships, both in your mentoring and in other areas of your life?

Patient: Living into my values? That's a strange way to put it. I suppose if I were doing this mentoring thing right, I'd be living into...maybe curiosity. And perhaps generosity too. Not just giving things, but giving time, understanding. But I don't know if I'm ready to be some sort of sage elder just yet.

Therapist: What would it take for you to feel like you're moving towards these values of curiosity and generosity, rather than trying to become someone you're not?

Patient: Well, I suppose I'd need to start small. I can't just become a different person overnight. Maybe just trying to ask more questions, really listen. Not just in mentoring, but with everyone. I don't know. It's not like I can just flip a switch and be more generous. But I can try, I guess. Just don't expect any miracles.

Therapist: What's one small step you can take today, in the next week, to start asking more questions and listening more deeply in your interactions with others?

Patient: I'm not sure I'm ready to jump into that. I can try maybe one thing. Maybe I can try to ask one person, one question. But I'm not sure how much it will help, but I can think about it.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to take action, even if the outcome isn't clear, and to see where this small step leads?

Patient: I'm not much for leaps of faith, if that's what you're suggesting. But I suppose taking a small step, just asking one question, and then another... Well, maybe this is a strange way to think of it, but it reminds me of a long string of code. I can't always see the outcome, but I trust that if the logic is sound, something good will come of it. But maybe that's just the data scientist in me talking.

Therapist: What if you were to approach your relationships and personal growth in a similar way, as a series of small, logical steps, rather than trying to see the entire outcome?

Patient: You make it sound so straightforward. But people aren't like code, they don't always follow logical patterns. I can try these small steps, but I can't just reprogram myself or others. But I suppose if I think about it that way, it does make it seem less daunting.

Therapist: What's one small, practical step you can take in the next day to apply this idea of iterative, step-by-step growth to a challenging relationship or situation in your life?

Patient: I've been putting off checking in with my colleague on a project. She's much younger, always has these new ideas. I don't always understand them, and sometimes I think she's just showing off. I suppose I can ask her to explain one of them to me. That's one small step, right?

Therapist: What do you hope to learn or gain from having this conversation with your colleague, and what do you think might happen as a result?

Patient: I don't know what I hope to gain, really. Maybe just a better understanding of her ideas. I don't expect anything big to come of it. She might think I'm stupid for not getting it right away. Or maybe she'll surprise me. Who knows.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to show up in this conversation with your colleague as someone who is genuinely curious and open to learning, rather than trying to prove something or protect yourself?

Patient: I suppose it would mean letting go of my ego, not worrying about looking stupid. It would mean actually listening, really trying to understand, not just waiting for my turn to speak. I don't know if I'm quite ready for that. But I can try. Maybe.

Therapist: What would it take for you to feel like you're taking a genuine step towards letting go of your ego and being more present in conversations, even if it's just a small step?

Patient: I think I'd need to remind myself that I don't have to have all the answers, that it's okay not to know everything. Maybe if I set an intention before the conversation, something like, "I'm going to ask her to explain something I don't understand, and really listen to her response." But I don't know if that will be enough. We'll see.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to take this kind of intentional approach to other areas of your life, not just this one conversation, but in your relationships and daily interactions?

Patient: You mean like setting intentions for every conversation? That sounds like a lot of work. I'm not sure I have the energy for that. Plus, it feels a bit too... I don't know, forced. But maybe I could try it with a few more conversations, see how it goes. I won't make any promises though.

Therapist: What if, instead of setting a specific intention for every conversation, you simply approached each interaction with a sense of curiosity and openness, without any preconceived notions about what you want to achieve?

Patient: But then how would I know what I'm doing? How would I know if I'm doing it right? Just being open and curious sounds a bit too... vague. I don't know. I'm not sure that would work for me.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to know exactly what you're doing or how you're doing it, you simply focused on being present with the person in front of you, and responding in a way that feels authentic and true to yourself?

Patient: But what does that even mean, being present? I'm here, talking, aren't I? I don't know about all this authenticity business. I am who I am, that's it. I don't see how that will change anything.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to change who you are, you simply accepted yourself as you are, with all your strengths and weaknesses, and approached interactions with others from a place of kindness and compassion towards yourself?

Patient: Accept myself as I am? That's easier said than done. I've always been hard on myself. It's how I've gotten this far. I don't know if I can just turn that off. But I suppose I could try to be a bit kinder to myself. Maybe. We'll see.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you might offer to a good friend who's struggling, rather than being so hard on yourself?

Patient: I don't know if I can do that. I hold myself to a high standard. I always have. It's not like I go easy on others, but I just... I don't know. It's different when it's yourself. But I suppose I could try to ease up a bit. Maybe.

Therapist: What would it take for you to feel like you're treating yourself with the same level of fairness and understanding that you offer to others, rather than being overly critical?
