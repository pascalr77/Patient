# Transcript T6

Patient: I've been going through a tough time lately. I recently moved away from my support system, and I find myself constantly criticizing my past decisions, especially when it comes to my financial mistakes. Now I am isolated and my stress levels are through the roof.

Therapist: That sounds really tough, being far away from your support system and feeling isolated. What role do you think your self-criticism of past financial decisions plays in your stress levels right now?

Patient: I guess it's a big part of it. I keep telling myself "I should be doing better at this stage of my life." But constantly thinking about past mistakes isn't helping.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "doing better"? What does that look like in your life, and what values or goals does it reflect?

Patient: I guess I mean more financial security. Right now, it feels like I'm just treading water, barely keeping up with bills and daily expenses. At my age, I thought I'd have more saved for retirement, be able to travel a bit, maybe even help out the kids with their college tuition. Instead, I worry about every dollar being spent.

Therapist: What does holding onto these specific financial goals and the sense of "should" around them do for you right now? Does it help you feel like you're doing something about your financial situation, or is it creating more anxiety?

Patient: It's definitely causing more anxiety. Beating myself up about not meeting these goals isn't helping me act on them, that's for sure. But it's hard to let go, I am just consumed by the idea I should of done better.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "do better" according to these old goals, you focused on taking small, manageable steps towards financial stability and security in the present moment? What would that look like, and what values would guide those actions?

Patient: Not sure I can do that. I mean, I get what you're saying. Even thinking about it makes the anxiety rear up, but... it's difficult to let go of those bigger ideas of financial success, you know? Feels like I am giving up on my dreams.

Therapist: What do you value most about the idea of financial success: is it the financial security, the sense of accomplishment, or something else?

Patient: I think it's the security it would bring. I don't need to be rich, but I want to know I can cover my bills, have a little nest egg, and not worry so much. It just feels like I should have that by now. But to be honest all that worrying takes a toll too.

Therapist: What would be one small step you could take today, in the present moment, that would move you closer to feeling more financially secure, and what value would you be living into by taking that step?

Patient: I guess I could look into creating a budget to understand where my money is going each month. I think that could help with the worry. Not sure why I haven't done that.

Therapist: What's one thing that's been holding you back from creating a budget until now, and what might happen if you were to take this step and start tracking your finances more closely?

Patient: Never really saw the point, if I am being honest. Part of me feels like it won't make a difference, like I'll just be seeing all the mistakes on paper rather than keeping them in my head. But, if I do make a budget maybe I can find some areas to cut back on or save a little. Also, I don't know where to start, and again that makes me feel like a failure.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to discover that you're not a "failure" because you don't know where to start with a budget, but rather someone who's willing to learn and take small steps towards financial stability?

Patient: I dunno, sounds like one of those positive affirmations people say, but don't really believe. I guess if I did believe it, I'd feel a bit better. Less stuck.

Therapist: What's one tiny, almost imperceptible shift in your thoughts or feelings that you'd need to experience in order to start believing that you're not a "failure" for not knowing where to start with a budget?

Patient: I suppose if I could tell myself that everyone starts somewhere, rather than beating myself up for not knowing it already... But that is easier said than done. It's hard to let go of that critical voice sometimes.

Therapist: What would it be like to take a few deep breaths, and when that critical voice starts up, to simply acknowledge it without judgment, rather than engaging with it?

Patient: It would be like a bad joke. Sorry, but simply breathing isn't going to make these thoughts go away. You might as well ask me to ignore a bear in my kitchen. But I guess I could try it, what else is there?

Therapist: What's one thing you're hoping to achieve or experience by taking a few deep breaths and acknowledging your critical voice without judgment, even if it's just for a moment, and what would that mean for your life?

Patient: I guess I am hoping to find a moment of peace, not letting the anxiety take over my thoughts. If I could do that, even for a minute it would be amazing. Maybe I would be able to see things a bit more clearly, if I can stop that voice from taking over all the time.

Therapist: What would it look like to live your life from a place of clarity, rather than being controlled by anxiety and self-criticism? What values or qualities would guide your decisions and actions if you were able to approach challenges with a sense of peace and calm?

Patient: Ha, that's a nice thought, but it feels pretty far off from reality. If I could do that, I suppose I'd be kinder to myself, more patient. Maybe I'd find some acceptance, rather than constantly fighting against where I am and feeling so damn stuck.

Therapist: What would it take for you to start being kind to yourself, even just a little bit, in this moment, rather than waiting until you feel like you're in a better place?

Patient: I'm not sure. Maybe just acknowledging that I'm doing the best I can, even if it doesn't feel good enough sometimes, or that life is not how I envisioned it. Maybe saying it even if I don't believe it. I dunno, this all feels so weird to me, being nice to myself.

Therapist: What would it be like to say, out loud or to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"? What would happen in your body and mind if you were to say that, even if you don't fully believe it right now?

Patient: Ha, I am not really sure. I guess it would feel bit awkward to say that, like I don't really mean it. But maybe it would take some of the weight off my shoulders, too.

Therapist: What would it take for you to start feeling like you truly mean "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough", rather than just saying it because it feels like something you're supposed to say?

Patient: I think I need to see some progress, even a little. Right now, it feels like I'm just spinning my wheels, and saying it doesn't make it feel any more true. I guess if I start with the budget thing, maybe that'll help.

Therapist: What would be a small, specific goal you could set for yourself around creating a budget, and what would be a sign to you that you're making progress towards that goal?

Patient: I guess I could start by gathering all my bills and income info in one place. If I can actually look at it all without getting overwhelmed, that would be a sign.

Therapist: What would be one kind thing you could say to yourself if you're able to gather all your financial information and look at it without feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: Well, I suppose I could say "Good job, you did it. See that wasn't so bad." But like I said, I am not sure I am gonna believe it.

Therapist: What would be the difference between saying "Good job, you did it. See that wasn't so bad" and genuinely believing it, and how might you start to bridge that gap?

Patient: The difference is one is just words, the other is actually feeling it. I guess to start believing it, I'd have to keep doing it, keep facing things I normally avoid. Maybe if I can do that enough, I'll start to see that I'm capable of more than I think. But it's hard, really hard, to get to a point where I want to do it without being forced.

Therapist: What would it take for you to start wanting to face your fears and take on challenges because you're genuinely interested in growing and learning, rather than just doing it because you feel like you have to?

Patient: If I am being honest, I am not sure. A magic wand? I guess if I saw some kind of results, maybe that would help. But right now it just feels like work I have to take on.

Therapist: What if, instead of focusing on the end result, you focused on the process of facing your fears and taking on challenges, and explored what small, incremental benefits you might experience along the way, even if they seem insignificant?
