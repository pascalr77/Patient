Patient: Hey, thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed by work. I can't stop worrying about my performance as a manager, and it's gotten so bad that I find myself procrastinating on important tasks. It's like I'm stuck in this vicious cycle and I don't know how to break free from it.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. What specifically about your performance as a manager is causing this worry for you?

Patient: I dunno, it's just a lot. I mean, I'm the one everyone looks to for answers, right? What if I make the wrong call? Or what if I'm not pushing the team hard enough and we miss our targets? I've even had nightmares where the higher-ups are shaking their heads, disappointed, you know? It's like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, and now that eggshells are starting to feel like quicksand.

Therapist: Those nightmares sound incredibly vivid and distressing. It sounds like a lot of weight is on your shoulders as the one everyone looks to for answers. What do you think would happen if you made a decision and it didn't quite work out as planned?

Patient: Well, that's the thing, isn't it? If I screw up, it's not just me that feels the heat. It's my whole team, too. I don't want to let them down, you know? I don't want to be that manager, the one that just wasn't good enough. But honestly, I don't even know what 'good enough' looks like anymore.

Therapist: You're really considering the impact on your team, which is admirable. What does 'good enough' mean to you in your role as a manager - is it meeting targets, having happy team members, something else entirely?

Patient: Ha! That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? I guess 'good enough' means...well...not messing things up? Hitting our targets, sure, but also keeping the team happy. Making sure they're not drowning in work, that they have what they need to succeed. I just want to be the kind of manager that people look up to, not the one they complain about at the water cooler. Is that too much to ask?

Therapist: You're really thinking about what kind of manager you want to be, one that your team looks up to and respects. What is it about being a respected leader that's so important to you?

Patient: Who doesn't want to be respected, right? But for me, it's more than that. I grew up watching my dad struggle at his job, always feeling like he was undervalued and unappreciated. I don't want that. I want to feel proud of what I do, and I want others to see that too. Plus, I think if my team respects me, they'll work better. It's win-win, right?

Therapist: You're thinking about creating a positive work environment for your team, and also for yourself, to avoid a pattern you saw in your dad. What is it about feeling respected by your team that you think would make you feel proud of what you do?

Patient: I guess if they respect me, it means I'm doing something right? Like, I'm not just some idiot sitting in the manager's chair, you know? It's like validation, proof that I deserve to be where I am. I worked hard to get here, and I don't want to feel like it was all for nothing.

Therapist: You're looking for validation that your hard work and efforts have been worth it. Does the idea that you might still be struggling to meet expectations, even with your team's respect, make you worry that your hard work was actually for nothing?

Patient: Yeah, that's exactly it. It's like, what if I'm still not good enough, even with their respect? What if I'm still messing things up? It's that constant 'what if' that keeps me up at night, you know? It's like a hamster wheel in my head, always spinning, always worrying.

Therapist: That "what if" thinking can be a real challenge to quiet down. Can you imagine for a moment that you're watching your thoughts, like they're clouds passing by in the sky - you see them, but you're not defined by them. What would it be like to observe that "what if" thinking without getting caught up in it?

Patient: Easier said than done, doc. Those "what if" thoughts...they're not just clouds for me. They're more like storms, thunder and all. I can't just ignore them. I mean, I guess I could try, but it's hard. Really hard.

Therapist: I hear how overwhelming those thoughts feel, like storms. It sounds like they're really taking up a lot of space in your mind. What would it be like to allow those thoughts to be there, without trying to change or get rid of them, but still take action towards what's important to you as a manager?

Patient: You mean, like, just let them be there? Isn't that kinda like giving up? Like, accepting that I'm always gonna be worried about this stuff? I dunno if I can do that.

Therapist: Acceptance isn't about giving up or resigning to your worries; it's about being present with them, even when they're uncomfortable. It's about taking action towards what's important to you, like being a good manager, even when those worries are still there.

Patient: Yeah, okay, I get that. But it's so much easier said than done. I mean, how am I supposed to just 'be present' with all that noise in my head? It's so distracting, and it makes everything feel so...heavy.

Therapist: That's a really common experience - feeling weighed down by those thoughts. Can you imagine that you're not your thoughts, but the space in which those thoughts occur? Like, you're the room, and the thoughts are just the furniture and decorations - they're there, but they don't define the room itself?

Patient: I think I get what you're saying, but it's still weird to wrap my head around. I'm not sure how I would do that in my everyday life, you know? It's hard to separate myself from my thoughts when they feel so...loud.

Therapist: Let's talk about a specific situation where you'd like to be more present, like a meeting with your team or a big project deadline. What would it look like if you could observe those thoughts about being a good manager, rather than getting caught up in them, in that moment?

Patient: Alright, let's say it's our weekly team meeting. I'm sitting there, and the thoughts start popping up. "What if I'm not saying the right things?" "What if they think I don't know what I'm doing?" Instead of letting that spin me out, I just...notice it. Acknowledge it, like "Hey, there's that worry again," and then...what? Just keep going? It's not like I can stop the thoughts from coming, but maybe I can stop them from taking over.

Therapist: Exactly, you can't stop the thoughts, but you can choose what to do with them. So, after noticing and acknowledging the worry, what would you do next? Would you still take notes, ask questions, or engage with your team as you normally would?

Patient: I guess so, yeah. I mean, I'd try to. It's not like the worries would be gone, but maybe I could...I dunno, compartmentalize them? Like, "Okay, thoughts, you can be there, but I've got a meeting to run." I'd still ask questions, still take notes, still do my job. Might be tough, but I could try it.

Therapist: That's a great start. Can you take a small step right now and acknowledge those worries, just for a moment, and then take one action towards running a great meeting, like taking a deep breath or asking a question to your team?

Patient: Okay, okay. I can feel that worry, right there in my chest. But I'm just gonna...yeah, take a breath. Just one. And now, hmm. I guess I'd ask my team how their week is going. Simple, right? But it's a start. Let's do that.

Therapist: You're absolutely right, it's a simple but powerful start. By asking your team about their week, you're not letting the worry control you, and you're showing up as a present and engaged manager. What do you think that might be like, to show up like that, even with those worries still present?

Patient: Yeah, maybe. I mean, it's not like the worries are gonna disappear, poof, like magic. But maybe...maybe it'd be like, I dunno, proving to myself that I can do this? That I can be a good manager, even with all the noise in my head. Maybe it'd be like...freedom? Just a little bit.

Therapist: That's a beautiful way to put it - freedom. What would it mean to you, as a manager, to have a little more freedom from those worries, and to be able to show up in a way that feels authentic and effective?

Patient: It'd mean...hell, it'd mean everything. It'd mean I could actually lead my team, you know? Like, really lead them. Be there for them, make the tough calls, all that. It'd mean I could finally feel like I deserve to be where I am, like I've earned my spot. Like I'm good enough.

Therapist: That sounds like a really powerful vision for yourself as a manager. What does it mean to you to be "good enough" in this role, and what kind of impact do you want to make on your team and the organization as a whole?

Patient: Being "good enough" means...it means I can look at myself in the mirror at the end of the day and know I did my best. It means I can make the tough calls and stand by them, even if they're not perfect. And the impact I want to make? I want my team to feel supported, to know they've got someone in their corner. I want to help this organization grow, to make it a place where people want to work, where they can thrive. That's what matters to me.

Therapist: That's a really inspiring vision. Now, looking at your current situation, what's one small step you could take today to move closer to being the kind of manager you want to be, someone who can make tough calls and support their team?

Patient: One small step, huh? I guess...I guess I could start by checking in with each of my team members one-on-one. Just a quick chat, see how they're doing, if there's anything they need from me. I've been putting it off, if I'm honest. But maybe that's where I start. Just...show up for them, you know?

Therapist: That's a great start. Can you commit to checking in with each of your team members one-on-one this week, and see how it goes? What's the first step you'll take to make that happen?

Patient: Alright, yeah, I can commit to that. First step...I guess I'll block out some time in my calendar for each of them. Just 15 minutes or so. I'll do that today. Get the ball rolling, you know?

Therapist: You're taking a great first step by blocking out time in your calendar. Remember, it's not about getting rid of the worries, but about showing up for your team and doing your best. You've got this. Keep moving forward, and let's touch base again soon.

Patient: Yeah, yeah I can do that. I'll schedule those meetings and just...show up. Thanks, doc. I think I needed that kick in the pants. I'll let you know how it goes. Talk soon.

Therapist: You're welcome, it was my pleasure to work with you. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress and how you continue to show up for your team. Take care of yourself and your team, and I'll talk to you soon.
