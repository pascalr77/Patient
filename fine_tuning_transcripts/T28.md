# Transcript T28

Patient: Hey, thanks for taking the time to talk today. Lately, I've just been feeling so overwhelmed. I moved recently, and it's like every little thing about the move sets me off. I'm snapping at people, even at work, which isn't like me at all. I just can't seem to manage this anger and frustration that's boiling over all the time.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. When you say you snap at people, what's one specific thing that usually triggers that anger in those moments?

Patient: I don't know, it's just... I guess when people ask me stupid questions about the move, like "Have you found a good pizza place yet?" or tell me to "Just relax, you'li get settled eventually," as if I haven't heard that a thousand times already. It's like they don't get how stressful this all is, and I just lose it. I mean, I've got a million things to do to get things in order at the new place, all while trying to keep up with work, and they act like I'm just on some extended vacation or something.

Therapist: What does losing your temper like that do for you in those moments? Does it help you feel like others are taking you seriously, or like you're being heard in some way?

Patient: I don't know, I guess it just feels like I'm blowing off steam or something. Like, if I don't yell, they won't get how serious this all is. But honestly, afterwards, I just feel guilty. I know I'm not really helping anything by getting pissed like that. I just... I can't seem to keep it in check, you know? It's like my filter is broken or something.

Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to be able to do in those situations, instead of snapping at people?

Patient: I guess I just wish I could stay calm and collected, you know? Like, if someone says something stupid or insensitive, I wish I could just brush it off or even explain why it's not helpful, instead of just blowing up. I just want to have a normal conversation without all this anger boiling over. But that's a lot easier said than done, apparently.

Therapist: What's one small step you could take in the next conversation where you feel like snapping at someone, to move closer to having a normal conversation instead?

Patient: Hmm, maybe just try to take a breath before responding. It sounds so simple, but yeah, maybe just pausing for a second to think instead of reacting right away. I don't know if I can do it, but I guess it's worth a shot. I just really don't want to keep being that person who's always ready to bite someone's head off, you know?

Therapist: What would it mean to you if you could consistently respond without snapping at people, even in tough conversations?

Patient: If I could do that, I think I'd feel way more in control. Like, I'd know I can handle whatever comes at me without losing my cool. Plus, I think people would probably be more willing to help or be understanding if I'm not always ready to blow up at them, you know? But that's a big if. It's not like I haven't tried to keep my cool before, it's just really hard. It feels like every little thing just builds and builds until I can't help but explode.

Therapist: When you say "every little thing builds and builds," what's the first small thing that usually starts to build up the pressure and makes it harder to keep your cool?

Patient: Probably just the little things that are still not done or aren't going smoothly with the move. Like seeing the boxes still piled up, or having to deal with some stupid utility issue. Those little things just start to pile up, and then when someone says something dumb, it's like the last straw. All that built-up stuff just comes pouring out as anger.

Therapist: Imagine these stressors and frustrations are like a traffic jam on the road to your goal of being calm and in control. What would it take to get out of that traffic jam and keep moving towards your goal, even if it's just a tiny bit each day?

Patient: I guess just finding a way to deal with one little thing at a time, so they don't all pile up and overwhelm me. Like maybe set aside a specific time each day to tackle just one moving task or issue, so I'm not constantly feeling like I'm drowning in a sea of boxes and to-do lists. I don't know, it's just hard to find the time and energy for that on top of work and everything else. But maybe if I can just chip away at it a little each day, I won't feel so ready to explode all the time.

Therapist: What's one small, realistic step you could take today to chip away at one of those tasks or stressors, even if it's just for a few minutes?

Patient: I guess I could just start by unpacking one box today. Just one, instead of looking at the mountain of them and feeling like I have to tackle it all at once. I can probably handle just one box, even after work.

Therapist: What do you think will happen if you take the time to unpack just that one box today?

Patient: I dunno, maybe I'll feel like I actually accomplished something for once. It's not much, but it's better than just feeling stuck and overwhelmed all the time. I guess it might also help me feel like I'm at least moving forward a little bit, instead of just treading water. But who knows, it might not make any difference at all. I guess I'll see.

Therapist: You're right, it might not make a huge difference right away, but what if it's the start of a pattern? What if unpacking one box today becomes the first of many small steps that help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed over time?

Patient: Yeah, I guess that would be good. I just hope it's not just gonna be another thing I can't keep up with. But I guess I won't know until I try.

Therapist: What if you approached this as an experiment, rather than a commitment? What if you said to yourself, "I'm going to unpack one box today, and I'll see how it goes"?

Patient: Okay, I can do that. One box, one day. Let's see what happens.

Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to have accomplished in your new home in the next few weeks that would make it feel like you're really settling in and making it your own?

Patient: Hmm, I guess just getting some stuff up on the walls. Like some pictures or art or whatever. Right now it's all just so bare and bland, it doesn't really feel like my place yet. But I don't wanna just rush into anything, you know? I wanna take the time to make it feel right.

Therapist: What does "feeling right" mean to you in the context of decorating your new space? What kind of values or qualities do you want to express through the things you put up on the walls?

Patient: I guess I want it to feel personal, you know? Like it represents who I am and what I care about. I don't want it to just be stuff that looks good but doesn't mean anything. I wanna see things up there that remind me of places I've been, or people I love, or stuff that just makes me happy or inspired. I just wanna feel like I'm surrounded by stuff that matters to me, you know?

Therapist: What if you took that desire for meaningful decor as a guide for making decisions about what to unpack and put up on the walls? How might that change the way you approach your belongings and your space?

Patient: Huh, I guess it would help me prioritize stuff. Like, instead of just trying to get everything unpacked as fast as possible, I could focus on finding the stuff that really matters to me and getting that up on the walls first. Maybe it would even help me figure out what stuff I don't really need or want anymore. But I don't know, it might also just make it even harder to get everything done. I feel like I already have so much to do, and now I'm adding another layer to it.

Therapist: What if you thought of this as a way to simplify your process, rather than add to it? What if focusing on the things that truly matter to you actually helps you let go of the things that don't, making it easier to prioritize and manage your time?

Patient: Maybe. I guess that would be good, if it actually worked that way. But I don't know, it's still just hard to imagine not feeling overwhelmed right now. It's like, even if I know what matters to me, there's still so much other stuff that has to get done too. I can't just ignore all the other boxes or stuff just because it's not meaningful, you know? But yeah, maybe it would help a little bit to have a clearer idea of what I actually want my place to look like and feel like.

Therapist: What if, as you're unpacking and organizing, you take small moments to pause and ask yourself, "Is this thing I'm putting away something that brings me joy, reminds me of something important, or feels true to who I am?"

Patient: Okay, yeah, I can try that. It might help me see some of this stuff in a new way at least.

Therapist: What if, as you continue to unpack and settle into your new space, you start to notice patterns or themes emerging in the things that bring you joy, remind you of important things, or feel true to who you are?

Patient: I guess that would be interesting. I mean, I kinda think I already know what patterns I'd see, but who knows, maybe I'd surprise myself. But I don't know, it's still just hard to think about anything too deeply right now, you know? I'm just so tired and stressed from all this moving stuff. I just wanna feel like I can finally relax and breathe again.

Therapist: You've already taken some big steps today, just by agreeing to try new things and exploring your values. Remember, it's okay to take it one small step at a time, and you don't have to have all the answers right now.

Patient: Yeah, okay. I guess I can try to keep that in mind. I just really hope this all starts to feel a little easier soon. But yeah, one step at a time, I guess.

Therapist: Before we wrap up, I want to remind you that you're taking care of yourself and your well-being, even in the midst of all this chaos. You're taking small steps towards creating a space that feels like home, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. I am trying, even if it's hard sometimes. Thanks for saying that.

Therapist: It was my pleasure to support you today. Remember, taking care of yourself and your well-being is a journey, not a destination. You're already making progress, and I'm confident you'll continue to do so. Take care of yourself, and feel free to reach out if you need anything.
