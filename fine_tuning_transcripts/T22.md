# Transcript T22

Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. Since I moved, I've been hit by this wave of sadness that I can't seem to shake off. It's even starting to affect my relationship. I just don't have the motivation to do the things I used to enjoy.

Therapist: That sadness sounds really tough to deal with, especially when it affects your relationship and activities you used to enjoy. What's one thing you used to do for fun or to connect with your partner that you've stopped doing since the move, and what do you think might be missing for you about that activity?

Patient: We used to go for walks together every evening, just to chat and enjoy the outdoors. I haven't felt like doing that since we moved. It's not just the activity I miss, but the easy conversation and connection that came with it. It's like the rhythm of our lives has been thrown off.

Therapist: That sounds like a really meaningful part of your relationship and daily routine. What do you think about the idea that the loss of this rhythm might be affecting your sense of connection with yourself, not just your partner - like, what part of you feels like it's missing or out of sync?

Patient: I never really thought about it that way. Maybe it's the sense of familiarity, the comfort of knowing what comes next. Like I've lost my sense of direction, not just with him but with myself too. It's all just so different now, and I'm not sure where I fit in anymore.

Therapist: That feeling of disorientation can be really disorienting. When you think about your relationship and your life now, what are some of the values or qualities you're holding onto as important - things that you hope to preserve or build on in this new chapter?

Patient: I've always valued our open communication and the ease with which we could just enjoy each other's company. Those things feel hard to come by right now. I want to hold onto those, to find that familiarity again, even if it looks a bit different here.

Therapist: That's a beautiful thing to hold onto. What are some small, everyday moments or rituals that you could start doing here, with your partner, that might help you feel more connected and like you're cultivating that ease and open communication again?

Patient: I'm not sure, really. I know it sounds simple, but even just sitting down to tea together in the morning used to be something we enjoyed. We haven't done that since the move. It's not the same as our walks, but it's something. I just don't know if I have it in me to start it up again.

Therapist: You're not sure if you have the energy to start something new, but you're also recognizing that it might be worth it. What do you think is the main thing that's holding you back from making that cup of tea together in the morning, right now?

Patient: I think it's just the weight of this sadness. It's like it's painted everything in shades of grey. I'm not sure I have the motivation to do much of anything, let alone find the joy in those little moments.

Therapist: What do you think this sadness is trying to protect you from, or what is it trying to keep you from doing, by making everything feel so gray and unmotivated?

Patient: I think it's trying to keep me from getting hurt again. If I don't care too much, if I don't get too invested in things, then it won't sting as badly if something happens. But it's also keeping me from the good things, the happy moments. It's all just so mixed up.

Therapist: That's a really tough trade-off to make - protecting yourself from pain but also missing out on the good stuff. What's more important to you in the long run: being safe from potential pain, or taking the risk of feeling vulnerable but also experiencing the joy and connection that comes with being fully engaged in life?

Patient: I don't want to live like this forever, that's for sure. I miss the joy, the connection. But the thought of going through loss again, feeling that pain... it's terrifying. I guess I want to find a way to feel alive again, but I'm just so scared of being hurt.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to push through your fear, you were to approach it with curiosity - what if you were to explore and learn from it, rather than trying to avoid it? What might you discover about yourself and your capacity for connection and joy if you were to approach your fear with a sense of curiosity and openness?

Patient: I'm not sure I understand what you mean. How can I be curious about fear? It's just something I feel, something that holds me back. I don't see what there is to explore.

Therapist: Let's try an experiment: when you're feeling that fear, what happens if you take a small step towards whatever it is you're afraid of, not to confront it head-on, but just to get a little closer to it? What do you notice, physically and emotionally, when you take that small step?

Patient: I don't know if I can do that. It's too scary.

Therapist: What would your life look like, and what kind of person would you be, if you were able to move forward, even in small steps, despite the fear? What kind of life and person would you be living if you were to let go of some of this fear and take a chance on connection and joy?

Patient: I'd like to think I'd be more like my old self. More outgoing, more adventurous. I'd be someone who didn't let fear hold me back. Maybe my partner and I would find new things to enjoy together. Maybe I'd find new things to enjoy about myself. But that's a big if. It's hard to see that clearly when I'm feeling this way.

Therapist: What does being "your old self" mean to you, in terms of values and qualities that you want to embody? What's one value or quality from your past self that you'd like to reclaim, and what small step could you take today to move in that direction?

Patient: Being my old self means being confident, curious, and open to new experiences. I want to reclaim my sense of adventure. Maybe a small step could be just exploring the new neighborhood a bit, even if it's just a walk down the block.

Therapist: That's a great start - exploring the new neighborhood sounds like a good way to start reclaiming your sense of adventure. What's one thing you could do this week to take that first small step, even if it's just a short walk around the block, and what do you think you might notice or experience in that moment?

Patient: I guess I could start with just a short walk around the block, like you said. Maybe I'll notice something interesting, maybe I won't. I don't know. I just hope it doesn't feel too overwhelming.

Therapist: What if, instead of hoping it won't feel overwhelming, you were to approach the walk around the block with a sense of curiosity - what if you were to wonder what you might discover, what you might notice, or what might happen? What if you were to approach it with a sense of openness, rather than trying to control the outcome?

Patient: Easier said than done. I suppose I could just see what's out there. See what the new neighborhood has to offer. But I'm not making any promises.

Therapist: That's a great attitude - no promises, just a willingness to see what's out there. What if you were to take that same attitude with the sadness you've been feeling - what if you were to approach it with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to push it away or get rid of it?

Patient: I don't know how to be curious about sadness. It's just there, weighing me down. I don't see what there is to explore.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to overcome or get rid of your sadness, you were to ask yourself what it's trying to tell you - what is it pointing out to you, or what is it warning you about?

Patient: You keep saying "what if". What if that's not helpful for me? What if I just need to feel sad for a while?

Therapist: You're right, I have been using "what if" a lot. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel sad for a while. It's okay to give yourself permission to feel and process your emotions without trying to change them. Can you take a moment to acknowledge and accept your sadness, just as it is, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I can try. It's just hard. It feels like it's swallowing me up. But I can try to just sit with it. For a little while.

Therapist: That's a great start - just agreeing to sit with your sadness for a little while. When you're feeling overwhelmed, what kind of kindness or support would you offer to a friend in a similar situation?

Patient: I'd probably tell them to take their time. That it's okay to feel this way. That they don't have to have it all figured out. I guess I could try saying some of those things to myself.

Therapist: That's a great insight - being kind to yourself and giving yourself time to process your emotions. What if you were to create a small reminder or ritual to help you remember to offer yourself kindness and compassion, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I'm not really sure. I guess I could write down some of those things I'd say to a friend and put it somewhere I can see it. Maybe that would help. I don't know.

Therapist: You're already thinking of some creative ways to remind yourself to be kind, like writing down encouraging things to yourself. What if you were to commit to doing that one small action this week, and see how it goes? Can you take a small step towards self-compassion and write down those reminders for yourself?

Patient: Maybe. I can try. I'm not sure it will help but I can give it a try.

Therapist: That's a great attitude - being open to trying something new, even if you're not sure it will work. What if you were to approach this experiment with a sense of curiosity, rather than expectation - what if you were to wonder what might happen, rather than trying to get a specific outcome?
